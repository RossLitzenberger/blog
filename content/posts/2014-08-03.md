Greetings friends!

After a few weeks of sifting, critiquing, formatting, copying, uploading, and archiving, we *finally* have the photos from our wedding.  I’ll tell you - for a day that seemed to have went by in a flash, I couldn’t be more grateful for the fantastic work of Amy and Brook to help fill in all the gaps.

Marissa and I are so thankful for everyone that showed up.  Thanks for making our day special.  Help yourself to any of the shots you feel capture how fly you and your loved ones really are.  If you would like any prints, pick out the ones you like (they are numbered) and shoot marissa an <a href="mailto:marissa@reckerfamily.com">email</a>.

Peace!

Mr. and Mrs. Recker
