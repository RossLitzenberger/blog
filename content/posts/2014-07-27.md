I just saw the movie Hercules tonight.  I have seen plenty of movies since my last movie review, so it must take a really special screenplay to get me to write about it.

As always, I don't apologize for spoilers.  But this time, ironically, I don't think I could spoil anything about this film if I tried.  The film uses so many clichés, in a way, you have *already* seen it.

So gird up your loins, ready your flanks, and add a little more oil to those ripling biceps, dear reader.  This is going to be a bloody one.

# Everyone speaks with British accents

The filmscape opens with a breath-taking pan of Ancient Greece.  Just incase we couldn't ascertain that from an obvious view of the Acropolis, the Colusseum, and white people feeding each other grapes (or distinguish it from Las Vegas), the specifics of every intended setting flash across every frame in tasteful *Papyrus* MS font.  This was no doubt a personal touch from one of the producers of *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* that stuck around for the shooting of this movie.

![No - it's not a plug for the nearest Greek restaurant](http://www.skhs.net/assets/images/dept/50/rest2012GreekMenu2.jpg).
 
Though we are clearly supposed to be somewhere in ancient Macedonia, every one talks with that lilty old sounding British accent.  Some characters even go as far as forcing the Cockney variation.  Seriously - the vulnerable, admiring stock character may as well have stayed in character as *Tiny Tim*.

Why do films do this?  Why is a somber British accent the only way to transport viewers to any date precluding 1900?

I'm no Historian.  I'm no Linguist.  But it doesn't seem right.  Lucky for them, my feudal system era history is as fuzzy as theirs.  I had no trouble forgiving the strange accents once I was immersed in the gripping dialog.

# The Rock always carries a stick

I could describe to you how 'The Rock' played the part of the son of Zeus, or I could save you time and just describe how 'The Rock' plays anybody.  He is always a venerated, but tired war hero.  Despite his street cred, he unapologetically recites his plight as just a 'regular guy trying to be with his wife and kids'.

Take the movie 'Walking Tall'.   The Rock is clearly known as the 'get business done' guy.  He is clearly the most physically imposing character in the town, but everyone knows he is just a regular guy trying to hang out with his family.  Bad guys come in (either crooked cops or hilariously dehumanizing entrepenuers... I don't remember), and Dwayne is forced to destroy them all.

Oh yeah, and he always carries a big piece of wood.

![I hear 'carry a big stick' was the only thing written down in his high school history notebook.](http://i.imgur.com/3lqo2E7.jpg)

In the provided context, Hercules may as well be whatever the *Walking Tall* guy's name was.  He is a grizzled, weary mercenary who just wants to live in peace and hang out with his wife and -- *ah*.  Forgot.  They're dead.  But there were so many flashbacks of them, I feel like I knew them as well as he did.

The Rock did OK, comparatively.  He had a decent British accent, and he even went through the trouble of growing his hair out like Jesus.  With that kind of haircut, it doesn't matter if you hire Tom Cruise, Christian Bale, or the Rock.  They are all going to seem the same - until they start talking.

# More clichés

Following Hercules dramatic introduction was an impressively unending slew of action movie clichés.  There was a rag tag group of misfits, a greedy deserter that redeems himself at a critical time, and plenty of dirty faced peasant extras to stare at the camera as your hero passes in a chariot.

The movie even capitalized on some of the Hunger Games hype.  The film also had a saucy female archer - only this one fought in a leather mini skirt.  There is this *totally original* scene where a clueless, sexists King snidely remarks that the battle is *no place for a lady* - then BAM.  Midriff Mc'Quiver extemporaneously does something irreproducibly difficult and threatening.

Additionally, the movie beats to death the oldest war movie trick in the book.  Hero gets in danger, bad guy slowly raises his weapon to kill him, then the bad guy keels over revealing a smirking supporting cast member.  Honestly, some "battle scenes" were just a ten minute long daisy chain of *this* scene.

Something that was entirely counter-cliché about the film, however, was the character demanded the most *my eyes are up here* time on camera.  Despite the presence of an effortlessly appealing - yet '*just one of the boys* female archer, Mr. Johnson's chest stole the show.  Do you know those abs and pecs sculpted into armor?  The Rock is one of the few people who can wear one of those and suffer from *reduced* cup size.  Watching him squeeze behind that thin plate of iron made me genuinely worry about his clear lack of comfort and support.  There's no sense in trying to make them look smaller, Dwayne.  *Just work it*.

# Pretty much everything else

So Hercules is traveling around with his rugged band of misfits working as mercenaries.  A shady king hires them to attack some villages.  He does his best to train the sad peasants into men, and after a lengthy, rousing training montage, they learn one unbreakable tactic - hide behind your shields and wait until The Rock kills everyone.

The first step into a trap wrought by half naked, slippery demon people.  They attack the Rock with scithes, which is undoubtedly symbolism for residual communist phobia in America.  They eventually ward them off and do a couple more battles.  Just after their final victory, the soundtrack introduces a strange, guilty feeling about their greatest victory.  Apparently, the Rock and his men have been helping a king take over innocent towns all along.  The Rock feels immensly guilty for aiding in such injustice, then throws a hissy fit in the middle of a royal feast.  The crew reluctantly take their cut of the conquest and leave.  It is then that he inspires his men to get revenge on the king for his betrayal and just, you know, kill all of them or something.

My question is this - why does a man who has been supposedly working as a famed mercenary for decades have a fifth grader's understanding of the consequences of war?  It's not like the evil king did anything completely unexpected or cruel after he captured the rivaling city.  He just sort of laughed maniacally while Hercules stared at him.

!['Man I love war.  I hope there are no negative social consequences though.'](http://www.marcusbronzy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2014/07/hercules-dwayne-johnson-600x271.jpg)

The rest is a heroic cascade of feel good filmography.  It turns out that Hercules did himself a favor when he taught the army to do nothing but hide behind their shields.  Three dead wolves, four tipped cauldrons, one broken statue, and one dead supporting actor later and everything is right as rain.  The army Hercules trained embraced him as their mighty leader (after watching him kill about a third of them).  We also got to see the sleezy traitor guy swoop in to save the day (though he didn't *woop* like Han Solo, which was disappointing).

# The meaning of Greece, myth, and life

After all the bad guys died, all that was left to do is close the book on mighty Hercules, who presumably went on to spend the rest of his life carrousing with tavern men and conceive hundreds of children.  The movie ends with a very special summary of Greek mythology - *be yourself*.  That's all those stupid poets were trying to say.  It doesn't matter whether you are a god, a centaur, or a Friday night Smackdown headliner.  What makes a hero is someone who isn't afraid to be themselves.

Oddly, I am OK with this.  To their credit, the movie was what they wanted to be.  It was ignorantly fun.  I didn't pay 11.50 to experience the obscure glory of Athenian culture.  I was just there to see Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson ride a Hydra.  As long as you keep those expectations (and you aren't afraid to just be yourself), you will surely enjoy this film.
