[{"fields": {"body": "Imagine yourself, sitting down for dinner with your family in a peaceful Rochester suburb, when you hear a knock. You reluctantly get up and answer the door, to see your neighbor, a short, smiley, frizzy haired 12 year old girl. After exchanging greetings, she says, \u201cCan I walk your dog for you?\u201d. This dog crazy girl was me, almost 10 years ago. I remember being so desperate to be around a dog that I used to knock on my neighbors doors and ask them if I could walk their dogs. Our neighbors were thrilled to have a free dog walker!\n\nFor as long as I can remember I have been obsessed with dogs. My parents weren\u2019t huge dog people, so my begging got me as far as a goldfish, a hamster, and some bunnies. As I grew up, my parents always said, \u201cwhen you get your own place you can get yourself a dog\u201d. When I went to college, my dream of a four legged companion did not go away in the slightest. In Wheaton there was a place called \u201cthe Puppy Store\u201d (aka heaven). You walked into the store and there are literally tons of puppies that you could play with in a little boxed off part of the room. When Alex and I were dating this was one of our favorite date spots. We even got on a first name basis with some of the employees. \n\n![](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/puppyStore.png)\n\nFast forward to this past October, Alex and I were engaged, he had moved into an apartment, and our mutual desire for a puppy became real. We had decided that a Pembroke Welsh Corgi was the right breed for us. I began calling breeders in Illinois and we had developed a relationship with one couple in particular and traveled to Western Illinois to be interviewed as potential corgi parents. We passed the test and many months and visits later, we were driving home with our first Corgi puppy, Oliver. \n\n![](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/oliverDeck.png)\n\nOwning a dog  has been one of the most rewarding and joy filled experiences of my life. But what I didn\u2019t expect from owning Ollie, was that he would teach me just as much as I thought I was teaching him, if not more. Here are the five most significant things that Oliver has taught me over the past few months.\n\n# 1. Patience\n\nI anticipated that having a puppy would challenge my patience. Cleaning up around a hundred potty accidents over the months gets pretty old pretty quick. But what I learned was that when my patience ran out, it was more of a reflection of a flaw with myself than with my dog. Ollie was not purposefully trying to frustrate me. He simply had not grasped the concept that it wasn\u2019t okay to go to the bathroom inside. The moments when I would be frustrated cleaning up Ollie\u2019s accidents were more due to my inability to be patient with my dogs learning process than an accurate reflection of my dogs desire to please me. I then identified that my level of patience should be more dependent on my dogs\u2019 intent than his actions. I would rather focus on my dogs\u2019 thinking process that foreshadowed his actions, than focus on his actions without identifying his thought process. I think that this system can be applied to other areas of life also. For example, if someone does something that bothers you but clearly didn\u2019t intend to bother you, shouldn\u2019t your response to them be different than if they had purposefully tried to bother you? Now i\u2019m not saying that actions shouldn\u2019t be disciplined, but i\u2019m saying that the thought behind the actions should be just as important as the actual action.\n\n# 2. The value of a mutual hobby with your spouse. \n\nWhen Alex and I were in pre-marital counseling, our counselor had at one point talked about the value of identifying and developing mutual hobbies together. I think that Alex and I never saw raising a dog as a \u201chobby\u201d necessarily, but now taking care of, training, and being with Ollie is one of our favorite mutual hobbies. There have been so many moments where Ollie has had us both laughing till we were crying. I truly think that having Ollie has made Alex and I grow closer together than if we didn\u2019t have a dog. Owning a dog together has been a blast! \n\n# 3. You learn that you may be good at things you have never previously tried. \n\nAlex and I took Ollie to puppy classes at a local center here in Rockford for eight weeks. There were anywhere from five to ten puppies all learning different tasks and going through different obstacles. Many of these obstacles where various agility course objects such as tunnels, weaves, jumps, dog walks etc. Over our eight weeks with Ollie, he could not get enough of the agility equipment. He absolutely loved every single obstacle. From seeing how much Ollie loved doing agility, Alex and I decided to continue to train him to do agility work. Agility only works with the dog and one owner as the handler, so I decided to be Ollie\u2019s agility handler and I cannot tell you how fun it is to run through an obstacle course with your dog. Working as unit to go through a course is an absolute blast and an amazing way to bond with your dog. I never would have thought that I would enjoy being an agility handler, but it is definitely one of my new favorite things! \n\n# 4. How to have a better situational perspective. \n\nOver the past few months I have been applying to Physical Therapy schools all over the country. The odds of getting into physical therapy school right now is less than 10% per school. The shift in medicine to being more preventative and restorative has caused PT to be a more highlighted part of the healing process. Because of this, schools are getting more and more competitive due to the hundreds of applicants each school gets for about 30-50 spots. So, understanding this, I have been receiving rejection letters from schools. This past week when I opened a rejection letter I sat there for a bit, a little sad, and Ollie came up to me and started to lick my cheek. I truly think that he was trying to tell me that everything will be okay. After that moment I started to think about how regardless of what happens, I have so much joy in my life already as a wife and corgi mama. Even though I would love to get into PT school, I know that my happiness does not depend on getting into PT school. \n\n# 5. What unconditional love looks like. \n\nThis past summer I was reading the book \u201cHow to be your dog\u2019s best friend\u201d by the Monks of New Skete. It was a fantastic book, one of my favorite points the monks made was that dogs are one of the best earthy examples of how to love unconditionally. You can literally be in any sort of mood, but does your dog ever treat you with anything less that love and joy? I think that dogs really are one of the best examples of how to treat one another. The fact that a dog can always act in a demeanor of love, is truly a challenge to me. \n\n![](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/ollieLookingUp.png)\n\nOverall, the experience of owning, raising and training a puppy has been nothing short of wonderful. Even as i\u2019ve been writing this, I\u2019ve had to stop multiple times to throw a toy, play a quick game of tug a war and laugh at how Ollie isn\u2019t tall enough to get the toys in the bottom of his toy bin. Honestly, I love my life. I love my husband and I love having a dog together. We have Ollie to thank for many belly laughs, lessons learned, frustrations stifled, and great adventures.  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "My wife takes the blogging soapbox from me this week as my very first guest writer.

We don\u2019t even screen these things anymore.  We just mash play and plunge head first into a three hour film about God-knows-whatever we selected.  Our queue is the most disharmonious thing I have ever seen.\n\nTonight we watched the documentary *Room 237*.  It was a film outlining fan theories for *The Shining*.  Marissa and I were inspired by all the crazy things people pulled out of this movie.  If you enjoy cinematic *forensics*, it\u2019s worth a watch.\n\nWe were particularly  amused by one viewers extrapolation of the whole movie as an expression of *guilt* for Kubrick\u2019s alleged participation in faking the US moon landing.\n\nBut I\u2019d rather not linger on it.  We wrapped up the documentary and got to thinking about the last time we watched *The Shining*.  We both felt we had taken it for granted.\n\nSo Marissa and I committed to watching every Kubrick movie we had access too.  Without further *ado*, here is our little summary of *Eyes Wide Shut*.\n\n# Alex\u2019s Thoughts\n\nA racy start to Kubrick Week, 2014.  There was more nakedness in the first 10 minutes of the film than in the locker room of my local *Planet Fitness*.  With no doubt, we had to pause the movie and project our doubts about what we committed to do.  I was also a little embarrassed that I had proudly tweeted *Hey everyone!  I\u2019m watching Eyes Wide Shut!*  I had no idea the movie would be such a *breast-fest*.\n\nI\u2019m not a Tom Cruise fan either, and what I know about Kubrick is that he has really high standards.  That puzzled me at first, but I think I can pardon his odd choice for a two hour, thirty-nine minute front man.\n\nClearly sex is an important theme in the film.  Beyond sex, *infidelity*.  Bill is haunted by visions of his wife cheating on him with a sailor, and it drives him to explore his own promiscuity.  He stumbles into a weird orgy club and quickly finds he is in over his head.\n\nIn the end, something as small as the mask he wore conspicuously left on his pillow beside his sleeping wife reduces him to crying (the ugly kind).  This is a long way to a fall for the sleek doctor we met at the beginning of the movie chatting of super models.  I took from it this - never underestimate evil.  No matter what you think you are capable of, never dismiss the idea that it could come back to terrify you.\n\nThere were more clues that lay in the password to the weird orgy party - *Fidelio*.  Wikipedia says this is Beethoven\u2019s only opera.  The story goes that a cocky politician is made a political prisoner, and his wife has to disguise herself as a prison guard to rescue him.  The opera is *a triumph to a wife\u2019s strength and love*.  I could see a parallel to Beethoven\u2019s version when Bill\u2019s wife forgave with the strength that she did.\n\n![Alright, I forgive you.  Just no more weird orgies.](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/10400000/Nicole-in-Eyes-Wide-Shut-nicole-kidman-10496276-761-556.jpg)\n\nAll in all, weird way to start off the week, and I am disappointed there wasn\u2019t more Nazi allusions and Moon landing related conspiracies.  I guess those will have to wait.\n\n### Alex\u2019s Rating\n\nIntriguing, but racy and a little drawn out.  Also Tom Cruise ugly-cries.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-half-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n\n# Marissa's Thoughts\n\nOne of my favorite perks about married life is that we introduce each other to a lot of things that we may not have normally tried on our own. I will be the first to admit that my taste in movies is not particularly refined. I normally like just about every movie I see, but Alex has a much better movie palate and has been able to introduce me to some truly fantastic movies. One of the more recent movies we watched together that I hadn\u2019t previously seen was the Shining. I know i\u2019m a little late with the classics, but of course I thought it was great. After watching a documentary about some of the subliminal messages that may be hidden within the Shining, called Room 237, we were inspired to continue watching some of Stanley Kubrick's films, starting with Eyes Wide Shut. \n\nThis movie struck me as being extremely unique. Normally movies are either very relatable or not relatable at all. This movie seemed to fall somewhere in the middle. Off of the top of my head I cannot think of any other movies that seem to fall into the same space. Eyes Wide Shut was relatable because it focused on a struggle that a large majority of people have in one way or another at some point in their lives: faithfulness. This could be faithfulness to a spouse, friend, faith, or anything. Tom Cruise's\u2019 character struggles with faithfulness with his wife but in a very \u2018real\u2019 way. He starts out thinking that he was the guy who could NEVER see himself falling into that trap and was even encouraged in this perspective by his wifes\u2019 own confessed problems with faithfulness to him. As the story continues this \u2018perfect guy\u2019 perspective gives him some \u201cself deserved\u201d leniency to explore more and more into some pretty shady situations. This is where the story gets a little unrelatable. Some of these situations he finds himself in are just a few fries short of a sci-fi happy meal, if you catch my drift. But they are still realistic and pretty interesting. \n\nOnce the movie was over I thought more about the story and I was pretty won over by what I personally thought that it was trying to convey. I think that we always see ourselves as the people who won\u2019t mess up. Obviously none of us try to seek out situations that will get us in trouble. Yet in one way or another we always will end up in sticky situations at some point, none of us are perfect. But the specific perspective that this movie pulled on is that the slippery slope into situations you never thought you would be in will always seem sci-fi to you. This is because you never imagined yourself ever getting to this point because we naturally are optimistic about our abilities to make good decisions. So after thinking about this I think that Kubricks\u2019 point here was to try to provide a bridge of relatability. By watching this story and understanding each step that brought Tom Cruise to the point where he thought, \u201coh sh**, how did I get here?\u201d but still seeing how crazy of a point it lead him too, may help us to understand that the same process can happen to us. Overall, I really thought that this movie was probably an 8/10. It is definitely rated R for a reason but it was very clever in helping us see that we are not immune to making bad decisions. Hopefully understanding this can just be one more weapon in our arsenal in decreasing the number of bad choices we end up actually making.\n\n### Marissa's Rating\n\nAn appropriately rated R movie that plays on something that we all face at some point in a creative and intriguing way, overall a good watch\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n", "description": "Kubrick Week kick off.

Maybe you thought I started to find more satisfaction and fulfillment in interpersonal interaction and I was dieting from the Internet.  Maybe you thought I died.\n\nYou are all wrong.  I'm here to inform you I am not dead, still uninterested in speaking to anyone face-to-face if I can help it, and ready to spew some more casual prose onto the Internet.  I haven't been writing much in my blog, but I have been coding.  I've spent the last week completely rewriting this site.  Although it may not look like a ton has changed - save a few widgets moved around, I reworked a lot of the plumbing.  Things are still kind of drippy, but as always we are working through it.\n\n![If any of my friends were wondering, this is how I would define you.  The 'classy' ones anyway.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/sadfriends.png)\n\nThis week, we are CC'ing our HR department, passing around the talking totem, and plunging headlong into an exploration of the human mind, heart, and amygdala.  You had better leave your *id* some place safe, reader, because things are about to get speculative and vaguely informed in the department of armchair psychology.  Conflict week!\n\n# Do like middle-children do\nI have been undergoing premarital counseling over the past few weeks.  Since the topic of conflict has been on my mind, I decided to turn the looking glass inward.  How do I handle conflict?\n\nIt might disappoint some of you to learn that my most resolvable depiction of how I handle conflict is as the typical middle child.  You can [read about it yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_order), but there happens to be a lot of controversy around the idea that the order in which your children are born manifest certain types of habits.  It saddens me to learn that it is not a popular idea, since I believe my family illustrates the theory quite nicely.\n\n*Siblings: chime in if I am off base here*, but I think we illustrate almost the perfect birth-order-psychology family.  According to the theory, Kelly (being the oldest), feels comfortable handling interpersonal conflict head on.  She focuses on the confrontation from beginning to end, addressing issues as they are brought up.  Kelly was always the best at talking to adults.  Although we are only two to three years apart, I always depended on Kelly's ability to pay the pizza guy, answer the phone, and explain to the baby sitter why I peed with the door open.\n\nSarah on the otherhand - being the youngest, would be expected to take a more community-oriented approach.  Most decisions started with her friends and family.  Let's take a vote, go around and share, take turns, and ultimately do whatever is needed to achieve the most equilibrium in the affair.    I remember footage of Sarah's 4th birthday party where she is putting down a hissy fit catalyzed by a wicked game of musical chairs.\n\nMe?  Middle children avoid conflict.  I read somewhere that a frequent staple for our people in achieving conflict aversion is *poorly-placed humor*.  As you could imagine, a child that prefers jokes in tense situations will spend most days wandering between well-deserved schoolyard beatings and parent-teacher meetings.  This was especially bad in fifth grade - which is like that magical eutectic between the *lowest* your intelligence will ever be and the *highest* your self esteem will ever be.\n\nI like to think that I have gotten better and dealing with conflict more directly, or at least waiting until things have cooled down enough for a more low-calorie quip.  I am happy to report that I pay the pizza guy myself now - albeit online - I still have do answer the door.\n\n![I nominate this guy as our mascot](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/chandler.jpg)\n\n# Girlfriends shouldn't be debugged\nBut leaving one nasty habit for another, I transitioned from the habitual *Too Soon* remark into a new, stranger way of handling conflict.  I *debug*.\n\nFor the non-weirdos here, *debugging* is the act of fixing an error in a program.  The best way I can describe it is like when you are doing math homework, and you discover that your answer doesn't match the answer in the back of the book, though in reality it's much more intense.  Just take the math homework analogy and add a twist of *Hunger Games* animal instinct and you are basically there.\n\nThe truth is debugging is actually kind of a brutal process.  When a programmer finds something conflicting in a program, they'll repeat the mistake hundreds, likely thousands of times - changing something small each time.  We'll repeat it faster, slower, with a smaller window, in a larger window, in firefox, in chrome, in Internet Explorer, half in opera - half in safari - until we've learned as much information about the problem as we possibly can.  Additionally, programmers will use what are called breakpoints - or a big red dot that we place on a line of code that sends the entire program to a screeching halt.\n\nDoing this daily, I started to confuse people with permutations and find myself *debugging* my girlfriend.  When a problem or conflict arises (like one of us has to pay the pizza guy), I often resort to the same animal sliver of my brain and resume debugging.  I interrupt, break, slow down, and ask questions at copy-paste speed.  Consequently, I come off as aggressive and manipulative, as if my determined scrutiny is really just a giant watchful eye waiting to catch her commiting to a fallacy.\n\n![In other words, I'm a douchebag.  Now which ladies haven't I debugged yet?](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/douchebag.jpg)\n\nI'd imagine this kind of thing rings true for technical-minded people even outside of programming.  People who spend all day mending garbled spreadsheets, dividing mililiters by microliters, and mapping billing codes may fall into the same trap, damaging important relationships.  It's time to have that conversation with *your* pizza guy, perhaps.  You guys' relationship is just too special to throw it away on a miscommunication unexplored.\n\n# The real reason I hate arguing\n\nBut diminished rapport pails in comparison to the real reason I hate arguments.  They're repetitive.  In what other area of life do we willingly partake in a semi-regular, mutual exchange of verbal sparring and hostility sometimes for hours at a time?  Arguments are time consuming, costly, and I'd imagine they contribute their fair share of traffic accidents and shooting range mishaps.\n\nI'd consider Marissa my best friend, but it can be no secret that Marissa and I get into conflicts sometimes.  If we didn't, the doctor would have to check either of us for robot parts where our genitals should be.  But I noticed that we were really only having three to four types of arguments.  I started to log them in a little text file in my dropbox.  We have one of them figured out so far.\n\nWe call it \"*I said thanks - just not in your language*\":\n\n1. Person A does something they consider selfless for Person B\n2. Person B does not notice because it isn't something they focus on\n3. Person A waits for a gesture of appreciation from Person B, but it never comes.\n4. Person A confronts Person B - probably wrathfully - much to the surprise of Person B\n5. Person B retalliates, defending numerous examples in which they were grateful for things Person A has done for them, followed by an explosive accusations of Person A for setting unrealistic expectations (ie, *Am I supposed to be psychic or something?*)\n6. Person A defends their need to feel appreciated, and is likely offended that Person B sees this as so ridiculous\n7. Persons fight until exhaustion overcomes them.  Once the adrenaline subsides, the reach a placated thesis together.\n\n**Thesis:** Person A needed to feel appreciated in a certain way for doing a certain thing - both of which Person B was unaware of.\n\nExhausting, isn't it?  By the third time around this nauseating carousel (alternating who was Person A and Person B that month), Marissa and I decided to *debug* this.  Any good programmer can take a series of tedious tasks and, after a few hours of sweaty self-doubt, turn it into a program.  If it sounds ridiculous, think of it objectively - if the same thing happens everytime, *why can't we just skip to the end?*\n\nWhich is what we started doing.  Here is how these arguments play out now:\n\n1. Person A does something they consider selfless for Person B\n2. Person B does not notice, because it isn't something they focus on\n3. **Person A references the emerging *ISTJNIYL*, informing them on both what they did and how they were expecting to feel appreciated**\n4. Person B calmly takes down the recommendation on a sticky note and remembers it for next time.  Both parties simultaneously reach an understanding that neither of them were being negligent, ungrateful, or unrealistic.\n\n![Then Person B commences Seinfeld rerun therapy](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/seinfeldtherapy.png)\n\nI'm not trying to be pious or anything.  If it helps, I'll mention that we've only really figured out one type of argument - but I'll admit it's really gratifying when we come across 'ol *ISTJNIYL* and resolve the whole stink in thirty seconds.\n\nThat's basically my approach to conflict now.  It doesn't work all the time, but I have had some successes in trying to find argument patterns - to really pay attention to how stuff resolves, then analyze to find out if we can just skip to that part next time.  It can't be too hard to pursue.  Everyone hates repeating themselves.", "description": "Don't be like that, bae.

I'm back after a long Christmas break to talk about stocks.  Bears.  Bulls.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica?  I don't know anything about stocks.  Prior to being illuminated by the film *The Wolf of Wall Street*, I thought being a broker was as easy as wearing a sweaty button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up and shouting at people.  Apparently, I missed the bit about drinking martinis and random office orgies.\n\nIn this movie, Leo plays the greedy, self-driven, pill-popping, yaht-tipping, booze-drinking (participle-using?) wall street stock broker Jordan Belfort.  He's a real guy too.  The movie is based on his memoir.  Belfort started a company that sells *pump and dump* stocks - really terrible investments that are artificially hyped so they will sell quickly.  After the company defrauded millions of dollars from their clients over about seven years, Belfort's company was taken down by the FBI.  All in all, it's a massively entertaining movie.  The film moves quickly, feels worldly, and features the most blissful Matthew McConaughey scene I have ever witnessed.  The only thing I want for Christmas this year is to learn that *this* scene was improvised.  *Pardon the ridiculous remix.  I was looking for a fragment of the scene that excluded his... other... advice*.\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VaNTcfOMSx8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\nThe movie is not exactly for the *morally* faint of heart.  The film made it clear that Jordan Belfort was really into some stuff that would have probably made Caligula blush.  Don't watch it with your mom.\n\nSurprisingly, as the movie's ending was horribly unsatisfying.  The fall from grace I was craving when the FBI had nabbed him felt more like a mere stumble.  After a long career in scamming, the movie insinuated he only got a few years of jail time.\n\nI was more curious about the *real* character.  Was he still alive?  Is he still in jail?  Did his heart explode from all the drugs he's done in his life?  As always, I went to Wikipedia.  I found out that Jordan Belfort only served *twenty-two months* in prison.  He was also ordered to pay back 110.4 million dollars to victims as restitution.  To date, Jordan has only paid back 11.6 million dollars.  Mind you, this is after book deals, a movie deal, and a successful motivational speaking circuit around the world.  Meanwhile, Belfort shamelessly markets himself as *the REAL Wolf of Wall Street*.  According to Wikipedia, Belfort told an audience in Dubai\n\n> \"I\u2019ll make more this year than I ever made in my best year as a broker.\"\n\nWhat blew my mind was that Jordan Belfort, a career scammer and real life anti-hero, is still making money.  The disappointing ending to the movie sort of seamlessly continues into the disappointing reality that this guy is still rich out of his mind off of the movie you just watched.

When did computers begin to be such a big thing for me?\n\nBecause it\u2019s such a long story, I\u2019ve only told a few people, and I usually do it in snippets. I decided to get it all down on e-paper. Lists are much easier to read then enormous walls of unbroken text. In this spirit, I\u2019ve organized the story around four trivial, admittedly embarrassing motivations that ultimately turned me into a pretentious neckbearded unix-thumper.\n\n<br>\n\n### 1. A Pretty Desktop\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/geektool.png\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe last time I remember being a normal person was January of 2012. I had a Macbook Pro loaded with all kinds of pedestrian tools. I looked like I new what I was doing most of the time, but I knew just enough to get by. I could right click, run my Time Machine backups, and throw together a pretty decent spreadsheet with Excel. I would say that I could also manage an iTunes library, but earlier that semester I corrupted my iTunes library, erasing all my music. The way I remember it, I was \u201ccleaning up\u201d files I didn\u2019t use. These files happened to be metadata used by iTunes to organize my music. Let\u2019s face it\u2026 I was a bafoon.\n\nI was still always into the asthetics of my computer. I didn\u2019t like how my Macbook looked like everyone else\u2019s, so I was always looking for ways to get ahead of the pedestrian masses. These were very small changes, like the black menu bar pictured below (which is achieved with this addon, by the way).\n\n![Lookout, everyone. We have a real genius on our hands.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/blackmenubar.png)\n\nIn my quest for the perfect, pretty desktop, I discovered something called Geektool. Geektool was a little application that displayed cool info on your desktop \u2013 anything from the time, date, IP addressed, calendars\u2026 even totally random numbers (which I was especially fond of). I downloaded Geektool expecting to prime a hayday of computer primping, only to discover something awful: it required programming.\n\nI was furious. Who would have thought you would need to program to make your desktop look like you know how to program? Ridiculous.\n\nI persevered anyway. After all, it was really important that I get random numbers on my desktop. I managed to just blindly copy and paste the commands I needed. Here is some of the work I conjured up from this scrappy method. This was a real blast from the past finding these\u2026 \n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt1.png\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 1</p>\n                <small>That\u2019s right. I put all those words there myself.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt2.png\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 2</p>\n                <small>More words\u2026 just avante-garde.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAt some point, I got tired of googling these \u201cscripts\u201d and decided to pull out some wires myself. I was a little bored with the same old thing. Some very light research told me all of these \u201cgeeklets\u201d were using a language called \u201cBash\u201d. Furthermore, this wasn\u2019t just a desktop customizing tool (believe-it-or-not). This was actually the default language loaded in the system terminal \u2013 or as I knew it, Terminal.app.\n\n<br>\n\n### 2. Night Class Boredom\nI first opened up the Macbook Terminal in the back row of a night class. I would have never even bothered if there was internet access (or if I had remembered to load more comic books on my thumb drive). I was greeted by a blank white box.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/macterminal.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>I wish I could tell you this was my \u201cred pill / blue pill\u201d moment, but I was already bored at this point.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nI would have closed it if we were talking about something interesting, but \u201cfeminism in Israel\u201d wasn\u2019t cutting it for me. I started hammering away at the keyboard.\n\n\thello\n\tbash: command not found\n\tprogram\n\tbash: command not found\n\thack\n\tbash: seriously?\n\nI tried every command I remember seeing from The Matrix, but it wasn\u2019t until I entered a simple \u201chelp\u201d that I was given something different to read from the command line. Almost rewarding me for my humility, I was given a full scrollable page of information. Somewhere in the manual page, I read that you could tap the TAB key to display commands.\n\nI double tapped the key, and it did indeed display possible commands I could type \u2013 all 3000 of them. In perfectly moronic fashion, I tried every single command. They were in alphabetical order, and most of them didn\u2019t do anything. But I was delighted to recognize a couple of commands from my Geektool experience. I further read that every command had its own manual page, accessible by \u201cman [command]\u201c. Holy canole \u2013 it was like Christmas\u2026 you know\u2026 for someone stuck in a night class without Internet.\n\nNext came my first program. This masterpiece I had in mind was a little doozy that could open my mail app, my web browser, and say \u201cHello Alex\u201d. Here is what it looked like:\n\n\topen /Applications/Safari.app\n\topen /Applications/Mail.app\n\tsay \"Hello, Alex\"\n\nA real work of genius, isn\u2019t it? This dizzying algorithm took me three hours working in the science center. But that little greeting at the end of my program was the sweetest thing I have ever heard.\n\nShortly after, I contracted mono just before the last leg of the semester. My finals week consisted of whimpering in bed, sleeping for 13 hours a night, driving to school to bomb whatever final I was supposed to take, and returning home. During this time, my choice comfort was lying in bed scrolling through the manual pages I discovered during night class. I wasn\u2019t even particularly thrilled with this activity, but I enjoyed the simple act of skimming a bunch of code documentation. It was just something to take my mind of the headaches and nausea during my bout with \u201ckissing disease\u201d (although I am pretty sure I got my case from eating pizza crust out of a garbage can).\n\n<br>\n### 3. Unixporn\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/unixporn.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nPreviously, I was really into desktop customization. When I made something I liked, I submitted it to the /r/desktops subreddit and wait for my blue ribbons. While on reddit, I found a different subreddit for the same purpose, only these desktops looked a little more hardcore. The group was called [unixporn](http://reddit.com/r/unixporn) (pardon the crass comparison). It was a place where programmers posted screenshots of their workstations. Looking for the approval of these mysterious people, I started to post desktops that focused on my terminal a little more. I wanted to make it look like I actually did what they did. Here are some more of my entries \u2013 all part of a more mature motif.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt3.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 3</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt4.png\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 4</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div><div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt5.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 5</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/attempt6.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<p>Attempt 6</p>\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThat last one I actually still kind of like. That\u2019s probably the best it has ever looked. But my peer-pressure overlords weren\u2019t so impressed. Every post received the same criticism. Another Mac user. Another dumb Mac user.\n\nI was really frustrated. What was wrong with my computer? What couldn\u2019t I do that they could? After crawling around on the bottom of forums and bothering enough elite users, I learned that they used something called \u201cLinux\u201d. I had never heard of it before, and I had no idea where to start. Thinking it was just another customization tool I could install on my Macbook, I consulted an apple support group. They snidely informed me that Linux was not an application \u2013 it was a whole different operating system. If I were to switch to the cool system that the programmers were using, I could not keep iTunes, Word, or anything that made up my comfort zone at the time. I regret that I couldn\u2019t find the original thread \u2013 because it\u2019s hilarious. I type something along the lines of,\n\n> It\u2019s probably not worth it to learn a whole new set of apps. I don\u2019t think I could live without iTunes. I think I\u2019ll just stick with OS X.\n\nAnyone who knows me know that was the lie of the century. That summer, I gutted an old Dell Dimension PC and set it up on my desk. I wanted to be like the hackers on the subreddit I worshiped, so I started with the most difficult version of Linux I could find: Arch Linux. This is what my desk looked like all summer.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/desk.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThat summer, my daily routine was a Starbucks shift from 3:00 pm to 1:30 am, then \u201chacking\u201d until about 5:00 am. I usually went to sleep when the sun started to go up. Unhealthy, yes, but this was where I put in all the honest work I was masquerading under all this time. By the time the summer was over, I was fully committed to Linux. The system that formerly was a hell of tinkering and petty research slowly became the freedom I was craving. Strangely, I grew addicted to the constant breaking and fixing and breaking and fixing\u2026 it was an endless cycle that made me feel more and more powerful every lap around the command line\n\nYou could imagine my satisfaction upon learning that I really was a hacker. A hacker didn\u2019t have to brute into private servers, decrypt hashes, or even know what they are doing. A hacker is something who works on a computer obsessively. In the documentary Hackers: Wizards of the Electronic Age, several patriarchs of the hacking culture describe the role of a hacker simply as someone who works obsessively on making something better (oftentimes never stopping to completely understand everything that is happening). Now that I think of it, it may not even have that much to do with the computer itself. I imagine you can be a hacker at anything, really\u2026 so long as the spirit is to keep moving forward (the spirit that often carries these type of people into less comfortable hours of the night).\n\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bl_1OybdteY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n\n### 4. Minecraft\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/minecraftbanner.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe last push into a full blown obsession with technology was Minecraft. It wasn\u2019t exactly the game itself that pushed me over the edge, but the game server. With the simple goal of getting people to play on the same world remotely, I was invigorated with a sense of purpose. What was a simple LAN server, turned into a fixed address off campus, which later turned into a domain redirection\u2026 Minecraft was the gateway drug into IT. And I couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly. What a ride. What. A. Ride.\n\nAnd I know for a fact that Minecraft helped get me the job I have today. Later talking to my manger, I was shocked to hear that he was mostly uninterested with my education and my references. What \u201cgave me a shot\u201d evidently was a minor footnote that mentioned my involvement with a java-based game server. There you go \u2013 never underestimate how well your hobbies can communicate what really motivates you. What seemed like a warmup question answered with a footnote on my resume really represented a desire to learn and be useful. Thank you, video games.\n\nSo that\u2019s the whole story, along with my 4-piece secret recipe for success. I guess the moral of this story is that obsessions aren\u2019t always to be feared. They can be dangerous if they get out of hand, but they are always valuable in what they reveal about your motivation. This is why I have always been an advocate of working a late night every now and then. While some will scold me for not getting enough sleep, I am just grateful there are still things that, when I think about them, make me too excited to fall asleep.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019m by no measure an expert in technology yet. I just better understand where I am going.\n\nThanks for reading. If it was uplifting or it related to you in anyway, please let me know.\n\nKeep \u201chacking\u201d,\n\nAlex\n", "description": "A reflection on how four different, admittedly embarrassing, pursuits derailed my education and got me a job in computers.", "title": "Obsessed with Computers", "image_url": "http://media.alexrecker.com/images/geektool.png", "published": true, "date": "2013-08-08", "slug": "obsessed-with-computers"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 6}, {"fields": {"body": "# I got married, etc.\n\nHi readers.  Since we last spoke, I went and made myself monogamous.  I have never worn a ring in my life - I\u2019m not a huge fan of wearing things on my hands (unless they are fingerless gloves and I am totally HACKING the PLAN3T), but other than that married life is fantastic.  I owe you all a full recount of everything that went down, so I am going to hold out on you until we get the pictures from the photographer.  I promise I will make a big, beautiful HTML page will all of the full resolution photos available for download.  Wouldn\u2019t you just rather hear about it all in one shot anyway?\n\nWe had a quaint honeymoon in Rockford, IL.  The *real* honeymoon was a 20 lb loaf of bread with half legs that we named \u201cOllie\u201d\n\n![figure 1: eat your heart out](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/oliver.jpg)\n\nOther than ordering pizza and romping with this little bundle of heartworm medication, my wife and I began our march that week through all five seasons of the acclaimed TV show *Breaking Bad*.\n\n# Too good to spoil\n\nWe absolutely love it.  Additionally, watching such an amazing show has got me thinking about my standard for good TV.  After mauling it over, I have come up with *three* rules good TV must always follow.\n\nI also have plenty of examples, but that comes with a spoiler warning.  Ethically, I have chosen the show *Dexter* to receive the brunt of my spoilers because, frankly, the show is a complete waste of time and you are better off finding that out without the *eight season* investment of your precious time.  In all other cases and examples, I think I can get by without hurting any of the shows I consider too good to spoil.\n\n# 1. All characters should be intentionally reusable and able to stand on their own.\n\nWhat I mean by this is there should be no characters that only exist to send more important characters down a certain direction.  My favorite example of this sin is in a character in Dexter named *Rankin* - a boating convenience store clerk.  To provide context, Dexter is scraping the bottom of a multi-episode emotional breakdown that is keeping him from killing.  Dexter has a short interaction with Rankin that ends with Rankin leaning in and shouting at Dexter - this is a direct quote - \u201cYour dead wife can suck my\u201d (and you can infer the rest).\n\nDexter kills the man.  The less thoughtful part of American may have sat at the edge of their seats, but I was furious.  Did the writers of Dexter really think they could break Dexter\u2019s cold blooded murder cold spell with a *disposable character*?  The reason I was offended so much by this plot device is that Rankin only existed to antagonize Dexter.  He had absolutely no human readable reason to say that to Dexter.  Not even a horrible, selfish person would think to say that kind of thing to Dexter.\n\n![I don\u2019t care if that IS your catch phrase Rankin.  Dexter is going through a lot right now.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/rankin.jpg)\n\nAnother awful example of cardboard characterization in the show is Cody, Rita\u2019s bizarrely generic grade school son. Cody is a walking Ken doll who only serves to show us that Dexter can frolick with kids.  I will give the writers credit in actually using his emo older sister - I think her name was *Assturd* - in something other that a *Hey look Dexter is such a family man what a great guyyyyyyyy* scene.\n\nWhat I mean is that characters should be able to stand alone.  You can\u2019t just manipulate the emotions of your viewers by bringing in meaningless characters like Rankin to do things that no one would ever do in real life.  No one could ever care about Rankin.  If Rankin was a protagonist of his own spinoff show, no one would ever watch it.\n\nA great example of a character everyone hates (done right) is Skyler White.  She is intolerable for the first threeish seasons of Breaking Bad, but there is actually something wrong with her.\n\nThe reason why Skyler is so selfish is because she suffers from [victim playing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_playing).  No matter what situation she is in, she can skillfully manipulate her own perspective so that she always believes herself to be victim.  This allows her to always avoid seeing her own faults.  It\u2019s a real psychological behavior, and it is why you cannot stand her.\n\nI think specifically of a scene in which Skyler is trying to break into an apartment that is not hers.  She does this by skillfully overwhelming a locksmith guy with \u2018how bad her day has been\u2019.  This kind of manipulation comes easy to victim players.\n\nThe point is that the writers took time to weave in actual behavior patterns to each character - and not just with Skyler.  I feel every character in Breaking Bad could easily be the star of their own novella.\n\n![Especially this guy.  I would read the hell out of that novella.](http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/saulgoodman__130409172658__130726211708-275x213.png)\n\n# 2. No seasons should end with a cliffhanger.  Period.\n\nPicture a room full of writers. They are under a lot of pressure to finish up a season in a way that will lock viewership for next season.  They get up to the last episode.  In the final blocks of writing, they face a dark temptation.  *What if we killed off this character, the BAM.  Screen goes black?*.\n\nCliffhangers are cheap, easy to write, and often go unpunished in TV.  Everybody talks about the next morning because, in truth, they add a lot of tension to a series finale.  But nobody ever talks about the consequence of that tense moment in the next season.\n\nSo your show returns after a long hiatus, and you are so excited to curl up in your snuggie and enjoy the long-awaited continuation of your favorite show.  But the season premier drags.  There is a lot of business talk and hemm-hawing, which doesn\u2019t really advance the plot much.  The show ends and you are disappointed.  How could a show that ended so well last season open drop the ball so hard this season?\n\nRemember that cliffhanger?  The writers flew too close to the sun, dear reader.  They could have saved all that cool tension and plot potential for this season, but instead, they had to write a cliffhanger.  Now they have to start a brand new season and there is nothing but cleanup, followup, and resolution to kick off a new season of inevitable mediocrity.\n\nCliffhangers come from writers that are not thinking about the future.  Great TV shows do not use them.\n\nThose who watch *House of Cards* can tell me off the top of their head what happened in the premier of season 2 that *changed everything*.  Now picture it happening in the finale of Season 1.  Sure - it would make the episode more exciting.  You would call it a night and fall asleep thinking about how awesome your new favorite TV show is.  But by the next time you sat down to binge watch it, you would have to sit through at least three episodes that do nothing but *reel* about the big cliffhanger from last season.\n\nYou can\u2019t just kill characters, then black out the screen.  You can\u2019t just announce that one of the characters was a robot all along, then roll the credits.  Sure - your viewers will return next season, but you have just made it exponentially more difficult to please them.\n\nTake the show Dexter.  Season 1-3 all ended elegantly.  Dexter kills the baddy he has been hunting all season, then a relaxing clip of him sipping a beer on his boat plays us out over some groovy latin smooth jazz.\n\nBut not season 4.  Nope.  The season begins to end just as the others have, save for *five seconds* panning over his murdered girlfriend.  Sure - America went crazy.  But no body remembers much about the show after that because the writers no longer had anything to offer.  They hadn\u2019t designed Dexter or any of the character to deal with a cliffhanger like that, so what follows is awkward, fabricated, and down-spiraling.\n\n\n# 3. TV shows should end lovingly.\n\nI am a big fan of Seinfeld.  One of my favorite things to do is putz around on the Internet while all 9 seasons play on shuffle on a second monitor.  Given that pastime, I have probably seen every episode at least eight times.\n\nBut there is always one episode that I skip - the finale.  The final episode of Seinfeld.   It breaks my heart, reader, but I cannot stand this episode.\n\nIn this zainy misadventure, the gang are arrested for making fun of a fat guy, then convicted to jail sentence at the testimony of every character that they have crossed.\n\nSome would call this fitting irony.  *Hey - a show about nothing actually ends with something.*  I call it abuse.  I followed a group of friends through nine seasons of petty banter and hilarious social commentary, and had, in a sense, made a home in Jerry\u2019s apartment.  What irks me about the final episode is how far away it is from home.  There is nothing familiar about the ending scenes.  There is no homage paid to the faithful backdrop of *129 West 81st Street, 5A*.  The show ended awkwardly, abruptly, and far from home.\n\nDo you know how it should have ended?  The episode before would have been perfect.  It was simply a montage of great scenes from the show, followed by a classy *farewell* from the king if funny himself.  I say just close the curtains there.\n\nOne show that ended surprisingly well, considering its spotty track record was *Scrubs* - and I can fully disclose it because it\u2019s not really revealing of anything.  JD leaves Sacred Heart hospital after a long tender flashback of all the good times he\u2019s had.  Then, as he exits the hospital, he sees his future projected on a banner, where we are vaguely promised that he eventually goes on to marry his on-and-off lover Elliot and stay in touch with all his good friends into old age.\n\n(and I know there is another season after that.  I have not watched it because I refuse to acknowledge that it exists.  I would advise you do the same).\n\n![In the last season, JD dreams that he is the puppet of a team of writers that have absolutely nothing interesting to add to an already great TV show.](http://tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/article/940/940499/scrubs-20081223104252259.jpg)\n\nYour TV show should end lovingly.  As a TV writer, you have a sacred responsibility to reward your loyal viewers with the resolution they deserve - especially if your show was about mostly nothing.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nI haven\u2019t seen the ending of Breaking Bad yet.  We are only on Season 4.  But knowing that it is officially the highest rated series in TV history, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about things.\n", "description": "Let's talk about TV.

Channing Tatum escapes the wreck unscathed, but his porcelain bride suffers amnesia.  She has no idea who anyone is.  Tatum\u2019s character does his best to help his wife assimilate into her routine life, but Rachel enters a panic and fights back (ranging from the cheeky \u2018don\u2019t-look-at-me-in-my-underwear\u2019 to a more serious emotional breakdown).\n\nIt seems the accident has set back Rachel\u2019s mental clock back a few years to a time when she was engaged to Jeremy, a hilariously sleazy and sinister caricature whom she had since ditched to hookup with Tatum.  As she knows it after the accident, she is still engaged to Jeremy.\n\nRachel, who escapes the grasp of Channing (who she perceives as creepy and deceptive) finds asylum in her family, who we learn have a rank disapproval for Channing.  The rest of the movie plays into the tension of Channing trying to win his wife back all over again, revisiting old feuds with his inlaws.  In the end, Channing charms his lady again, and remarries with the warm approval of her ridiculous family.\n\n<br>\n\n### What's Wrong with the Movie\nThere are a number of things wrong with the movie.  I\u2019ll start with the biggest.  The plot should have never gotten thick from the beginning.  It was a tragic accident \u2013 it\u2019s understandable that the two would be a little shaken up, and even medically plausible to get that grade of amnesia.  But I still don\u2019t see how the movie lasted longer than fifteen minutes.  Here\u2019s how an actual human being would have acted in Tatum\u2019s situation:\n\n1. Take your wife home.  Be as gentle as possible, as it is clear she doesn\u2019t remember anything about you.  Show her pictures, talk about the accident, and try to get her to relax.  Maybe even \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 whip out that old marriage license of yours \u2013 you know \u2013 that binding legal document that she signed.  Oh \u2013 and whatever you do, don\u2019t throw her any surprise parties.\n\n2. At this point, she will freak out and run to her family\u2019s house.  Calmly call your in-laws and explain to them that your wife is freaking out because of an accident.  Ask them to help jog her memory and bring her back home.\n\n3. In the event that your in-laws, for some reason, see this horrible accident as an opportunity to dissolve your marriage, ruin your life, and marry off your wife to \u2013 literally \u2013 the worst (and in a way, the coolest) piece of slime to walk the earth, don\u2019t panic.  Simply carry the marriage license (that should already be in your hand) to the police station along with a doctor\u2019s note.  When you get there, tell them your wife has been kidnapped.  Chicago\u2019s finest sends a squad car to their dope mansion and tear gasses the hell out of it.  You remove your wife and take her to a therapist.\n\nThere.  The movie has finished in a day (in movie time, that should only take a few minutes to play out).\n\nBut why Tatum, rather than recognizes that his wife was kidnapped, complacently resigns to just trying to win back his wife is beyond me.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/channingguitar.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>In the sequel, Channing Tatum\u2019s son is kidnapped.

It\u2019s not my style just to burn something down, then walk away.  I\u2019m going to stay with this mess and rebuild it.  You and me, dear reader \u2013 we\u2019re going to build a better The Vow.\n\n<br>\n#### Step 1: Make them engaged instead of married\n\nThis is the most obvious of improvements.  When you start with the main characters being engaged, it removes all tension from the movie (at least from an intelligent movie).  When they start off as married, you are already giving the protagonist an obvious legal advantage over everyone in the movie.\n\nIn order to commit to this mistake, the powers-that-be had to violate a rule to good movies that I hold sacred - two bad decisions in a row.\n\nTo elaborate, when a character makes a bad decision (defined \u2013 one that average Joe sitting in the audience can obviously perceive as irresponsible, morally reprehensible, or self-destructive), it is the sacred duty of the writers and director to ostracize the character.  Thieves must be brought to justice, sluggards must come up short, and the proud have to end up looking stupid.  There are exceptions to the rule only for making a tragic point, but for the most part (especially in this class of movies), you have to ostracize bad decisions.  In The Vow, Rachel\u2019s family made a bad decision.  They felt it was ok to break apart their marriage opportunistically.  Rather than affirming our disgust by channeling it through Tatum\u2019s character, we are forced to watch him make a bad decision.  He decides to try to win his wife back by dating her.  That makes two bad decisions.  The result?  You have just cut the cord tying your film to reality.  The audience drifts into the atmosphere and burns up in their own thoughts for the remaining 70 minutes.\n\nHere is what you do.  Make them engaged.  Getting engaged is a very volatile time for any couple.  You seem to have the emotional commitment that comes with marriage, but there are no legal advantages.  You could even keep the jackass ex-fiance, the malice-filled family, and the mopey protagonist.  Because in this case, he would have no choice but to win her over again.  It lends itself to all of the tension the movie was trying to sell us.  I am continually surprised that this wasn\u2019t the case, especially since all of the dialog could be preserved (save a quick search/replace).  The only change would be that the movie would make a little more sense.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Step 2: Get a new actor\n\nI don\u2019t see what everyone else sees in this guy.  Watching his heart getting ripped up didn\u2019t really do anything for me.  Channing Tatum\u2019s version of sadness makes me feel like I am trying to stay out of a depressed coworkers way.  I just recognize that he is really bummed, but I am too scared to ask about it because he is too mopey, not very articulate, and \u2013 after all \u2013 I\u2019m at work too.\n\nAdditionally, I do not believe this guy to be a native Chicagoan for a second.  Throughout the movie, I was convinced his entire wardrobe had to be custom-made.  There is no way any of those clothes meant for a wire-framed urban sociologist were available in the body-builder cut.  Tatum looks like a fresh Hollywood-to-Chicago organ transplant of a man (and Chicago\u2019s antibodies are thoroughly rejecting him).  Tatum is mopey, burly,  wimpy, and draws about as much empathy as a sepia-toned magazine page.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/channingsweater.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Nothing says \u2018likeable street-urchin\u2019 like a new hemmed sweater in every shot.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nYou want a guy whose side you can get on?  Who can get a laugh out of you while he looks stupid in front of his in-laws, but steal a little bit of your courage when he reaches breaking point?  I\u2019ve got just what the doctor ordered.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/paulrudd.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Paul Rudd: take twice daily crushed up in yogurt.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nBAM.  I\u2019m already tearing up a little.  Paul Rudd would nail this role.  He\u2019s the perfect urbanite-gone-romantic.  You want the guy whose voice is even a little bit funny to carry a movie with a lot of implied comedy that eventually needs to come up with some sincerity.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Step 3: Just give the girl her memory back already\u2026\nDrawing to the end of the film, I was surprised that they gave me such a lukewarm resolution.  That\u2019s all?  She just accepts that she is married to this guy and her memory is never restored?\n\nIf I know you at all, dear reader, I know that you are unsatisfied with that too.  Not to worry.  I have got some real chicken soup for your soul.  This revised ending is going to need a wordpress-typewriter font to bring it home.\n\n<br><hr>\nPaul Rudd grabs Rachel's sleeve as she spins up from his patchy sofa.  Her damp sweater tears as she bolts for his door.  Paul leaps to his feet running after her.  A staggering Rachel, followed by a weary Paul, emerge from a door into the middle of a street applauded with torrential rain.  Rachel's pounding feet slow to a halt as Paul begs her to stop.\n\n\"I don't know what you want me to do,\" gasps Paul, as he clutches his knees, rain falling off his nose.  \"I'm so angry.  I had you.  We were going to be together.  Everything was so perfect... but it's all falling apart now.\"\n\n\"But I can't know that!\"  Rachel screams as she whips her head in the rain.  \"I don't love you - and I can't be with you just because you want to tell me that you already had me.  I don't love you, Paul.\" \nPaul breathes heavily, as Rachel clutches her knees to catch her breath with him.  He saunters closer to her.  \"Shine On\" by James Blunt fades in as Paul rises to his feet.  \n\n\"I love you, Rachel.  And there is nothing you can do about that.  And if I have to, I'll fight for you again now, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life until you remember.\" \n\nPaul draws Rachel in forcibly for a hug.  She resists, as we are given Rachel's perspectives.  The jerk from his desperate clutch brings her back to the car wreck.  She sees her body thrown through the windshield over stuttered dialog of the moment Paul asked her to marry him.  The camera fades to back.  Rachel's arms hang lifelessly behind Paul, but her fingers tighten as she clutches his back.  All the memories of their life together begin to rush back as James Blunt enters the chorus.  They cry... hug... whatever... as we feel the anxiety slip off of Paul's shoulders (and perhaps even, our own).  \n\nCredits roll.  Families hug.  Ex-cons confess their crimes.  Movie theaters decide to charge less for food.\n<hr>\n\nFine \u2013 maybe the dialog may need some tooling, but for a first draft on the internet, that is a lot better than what they had.\n\nSo that\u2019s my two cents about this stupid movie.

Despite Anakin\u2019s bizarrely flat characterization, how incoherent the plot of The Phantom Menace was, my lack of research on the topic beyond contextless buzzwords scrawled from Wikipedia to the back of a Chinese takeout menu, and the fact that I yammered the whole document in between generous bites of a s\u2019mores Pop-Tart two pack, I got out a-dodge with a cool 48/50.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/anakin.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>It\u2019s true \u2013 Anakin shows as much character depth as a barnacle, a shoelace, or Channing Tatum.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nDownload the PDF version [here](http://media.alexrecker.com/documents/Anakin.pdf).\n\nAnd so, without further ado, I give you The Phantom Menace: A Character Study.\n\n<hr>\n\nStar Wars: The Phantom Menace confounded Star Wars universe aficionados and movie critics alike when it rose to the top of the saga as the most powerful Star Wars film ever written, all while boldly overstepping the status quo of the films that came before it. The film's success in theaters, without a doubt, was due to its authentic exploration of a dazzling variety of rich relationships \u2013 Jedi master and Padawan, magistrate and citizen, and mother and son \u2013 propelled by political intrigue, the struggle for justice, and bravery in the face of decimation. In short, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a cinematic masterpiece.\n \nThough every character in the film bears a respectable developmental path which hardly deserves to be ignored, I have chosen in this paper to focus on the journey of Anakin Skywalker. Anakin, fittingly, had odd beginnings. On the arid planet of Tattooine, Schmi Skywalker conceived him immaculately. As she recounted to Qui-gon Jin, \u201cThere was no father\u201d. Despite is undeniably special origin, Anakin was born into poverty. He and his mother were sold to Wotto, a disagreeable junk dealer and urchin of society. Forbidden to leave the planet, Ani and his mother must make a solace of their hell. Ani keeps himself busy . tinkering with droids, conversing with space pirates, and playing with his neighborhood friends. Together, he and his mother live in a humble, quaint sand hut near the outside of the city.\n\nAnakin's beginnings provide us insight into our first two developmental themes. Our first theme is the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on a child's development. It was discussed in class this semester that child's socioeconomic status can affect many aspects of its development. Because its family may not have access to nutrition and health care, the child may be persistently malnourished and unhealthy. These disadvantages inevitably propagate into the child's cognitive development. If there are physical ailments inhibiting the brain from physically developing and growing, there is little hope the child will react well to intellectual stimulation. As a parallel struggle, it would be typical for Schmi to be too preoccupied by her job to provide Anakin the proper exposure of vocabulary. But the film tells a different story. Anakin amazingly overcomes his socioeconomic status. Anakin appears fit and active, and has developed healthy eating habits. He is seen showing Qui-gon fruit at the local market, as well as happily eating an organic meal at home. Anakin is very mentally active as well. It is evident that he acts as the house's \u201chandy man\u201d. Additionally, Anakin is persistently tinkering with robotics, whether he is working on his protocol droid to assist his mother or laboring over his pod racer. Though it is unclear how much time Schmi can afford to spend with Ani, there is mutual and tender respect. In this regard, Anakin defied the statistics of his situation. Although he was subject to the dangers of growing up with a low socioeconomic status, he maintained a developmentally healthy lifestyle.\n \nA second of aspect of development we must reconcile with Anakin's early life is the idea of family structure vs function. It was confirmed through class discussion that the function of a family is vastly more critical to a child's developmental health than that family's structure. It is how a family interacts with its members and extended members that determines the health of an environment, and not the structure itself. Anakin was raised by a single mother. Without a second parent, much strain can be perpetuated in household relationships as the single parent must walk the thin line between complete provider and imminent parent. Anakin's mother Schmi was, evidently, well equipped to for the task of raising him as a single parent. Strong, wise, collected, loving \u2013 these were all characteristics she modeled for young Anakin Skywalker. Schmi, in her strength, exemplified how a family's function can overcome shortcomings in its structure.\n \nAnakin's life takes a dramatic turn upon his serendipitous union with Qui-gon Jin. Qui-gon, who is looking to replace a hyper drive on his getaway ship, happens to enter Wotto's shop. In this scene, Anakin also meets Padame for the first time. Here, we get a humorous glimpse at the social skills Anakin has acquired up to this point. In class, many aspects of social skills were discussed. These included managing emotions, reading others' emotions, nonverbal communication, conversation, listening, personal space, and approaching others. Anakin sees Padame enter his shop, and without hesitation asks \u201cAre you an angel?\u201d Padame, flustered by the odd inquiry, does here best to respond just as playfully, remarking, \u201cYou're a silly little boy.\u201d Throughout the conversation, Anakin demonstrates good listening skills, respect for personal space (despite his immediate infatuation for Padame), and conversational rhythm. Although his introduction was odd, Anakin establishes a rapport of potential with Padame and her crew using his charming personality.\n \nFollowing introductions, a dust storm drives Qui-gon and his crew into Anakin's home, where his mother Schmi welcomes them with a gentle heart. Here, as Anakin eagerly gives Padame a tour of his humble living quarters, we are given a glimpse into the fourth concept \u2013 Erikson's stage of industry vs. inferiority. According to Erikson's theory, children at around the age of Anakin become gripped with their own competence. This is the central task they are given, and if they fail, they must compromise with inferiority. Anakin loves to tinker. Mechanical robot parts, shop tools, and machines fill the floor and walls of his bedroom. It is quite evident that Anakin is fixated on his own mastery of skills. Anakin is working on a scanner to find the slave chip implanted in him and his mother, building a protocol droid to help around the house, and constructing a pod racer all while working in Wotto's shop. Additionally, Anakin is eager to show off his accomplishments, reminding his mother and informing his guests of all the things he is working on. He enjoys the viscous competition of intergalactic high-stakes pod racing, priding himself in being the \u201conly human that can race pods\u201d. Throughout the race, Anakin demonstrates a high level of dexterity and competence, using his sharp instincts to subdue his competitors and win his freedom \u2013 all while retaining unflinching optimism and confidence. Erikson, along with his mother, would be proud.\n \nLastly, we find the fifth and final theme of developmental psychology. We are given intimate insight into Anakin's high level of morality while he is speaking with Qui-gon Jin. According to Kholberg, there is the pre conventional stage (which includes obedience and self interested perspective), conventional (which includes interpersonal relationships and social order), and post conventional (which includes higher universal ethical principles). When Anakin is confronted with the choice to leave with Qui-gon, he reveals that his motivation to develop his supernatural gifts and train as a Jedi is primarily motivated by a post conventional moral perspective. Anakin reminds his mother, \u201cthe biggest problem in the universe is that no one helps each other.\u201d Anakin has a remarkably giving spirit and, according to Kholberg's scheme, a very highly developed moral attitude. Anakin is motivated by helping others, ultimately aspiring to return to his home planet and, championing his Jedi training, free his fellow slaves.\n \nIn studying Anakin's behavior in The Phantom Menace, I am led to conclude his character is especially strong. Anakin overcomes the disadvantages of a low socioeconomic status and being raised by a single mother. Anakin also demonstrates an admirable eagerness for social interaction and a commendable determination to master his crafts. Lastly, Anakin shows great maturity in his understanding of universal ethical principles.In The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker illustrates healthy developmental behavior. Sadly, his pristine example quickly decays as he falls under the influence of Darth Sidious. The same is true for our lives \u2013 our development as people is never finished. The fruits of a healthy upbringing are always in danger of being rotted by a slothful adolescence and a hateful adulthood. Anakin, a gleaming, optimistic, and deeply moral boy was corrupted \u2013 forsaking his roots to become one of the most evil tyrants in the galaxy. It is wise to always consider development as a process \u2013 never settling for who we are in the now, but pursuing who we could be.", "description": "Let's examine the psyche of everyone's favorite kid Jedi - Anakin Skywalker.", "title": "Anakin", "image_url": "http://media.comicbookmovie.com/images/uploads/phantom-menace-banner.jpg", "published": true, "date": "2013-09-15", "slug": "anakin"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 9}, {"fields": {"body": "Marissa and I just finished our march through all 10 seasons of Friends.  I committed to watching the show about six months ago.  I was hesitant at first.  Being a devoted Seinfeld fan, the idea of making room in my heart for another pop sensation portrayal of regular people set in New York irked me.  Ten seasons later, I am starting to assemble my doubts, critiques, musings for people without any meaningful hobbies to read (I kid \u2013 please don\u2019t find any hobbies and continue reading).  Between Seinfeld and Friends \u2013 which sitcom is supreme?\n\n# Seinfeld Remained Emotionally Sterile\nOne virtue that Seinfeld remained true to is that they never made you care about a character for longer than twenty minutes.  Dating relationships among the gang rarely spanned longer than a short story arc, and even the ones that did never demanded any intellectual investment from the viewer.\n\nWhy is a bizarrely emotionally sterile universe a good thing?  This gave the show watchability.  The reason why Seinfeld reruns are the best kind of reruns is because the story doesn\u2019t matter.  There is no important context beyond the episode.  What is the result?  There is no important order to the seasons.  Even the reoccurring characters can stand on their own in each episode.  You don\u2019t need to backtrack to understand Elaine\u2019s boyfriend Putty is a numskull who barely redeems the relationship with raw physical attraction.  There is no briefing required to understand that George\u2019s fiance Susan is smarter than he is and pushes George into commitments that he is not mature enough for.   It only takes a few seconds to learn everything you need to know about a character \u2013 whether it is their first appearance of fiftieth.\n\nYou can watch them in any order.  There is no more tension in the middle of the season than there is in the end of the season.  You are never required to take anything with you between episodes.\n\nI felt Friends was weakest in this area.  I would enjoy myself in the middle of seasons, but by the last few episodes of the season, there was too much contrived television tension to enjoy what was going on.\n\nMy favorite bit of irony in this fault was watching Joey ham it up in a laughable soap opera performance, then put on a similar performance in the show\u2019s actual plot under the expectation that we are now supposed to take them all seriously.\n\nI would imagine this comes from pressure on the writers.  They just wanted to keep people interested in-between seasons.  Consequently, they resorted to kitchy cliffhangers and sacrificed the emotional sterility championed by Seinfeld.\n\nI would like to bring you to the pinnacle of Seinfeld\u2019s strength.  In the end of season 7, George\u2019s fiance Susan suffers a bizarre death during wedding preparation.  As the gang watches a stoic doctor give George the grave news, the show reaches a crossroad.  The sitcom stared directly into the face of an emotional commitment.  What do they do?  Watch (sorry about the quality\u2026 I think this might be a bootleg of a bootleg).\n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xBAJjmN7JWE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\nExactly.  They all just go out for coffee \u2013 and not because they want to help George get over it \u2013 but because they are all *bored*.  Staring in the face of their first emotional story arc, the writer\u2019s of Seinfeld bravely nod, turn on their heels, and go back down the mountain.  Season 8 begins just like all the others with no trace of emotional scarring.  Not even a death interrupted their rhythm.\n\n# The Finale of Friends was Fantastic\nBy far the greatest strength of Friends was the show\u2019s finale.  My greatest disappointment with Seinfeld was how in the last episode, too many things happened.  There was no time to reflect on what had just happened over the last nine years.  I have been saying for years \u2013  that all I wanted from the show\u2019s finale was a silly plot, a slow pan over an empty apartment, and the ending credits.  I\u2019m confident that this won\u2019t give away any spoilers, but this is ultimately exactly what Friends did with the last episode.  I was jealous.\n\nHonestly, the last episode of Seinfeld has been the most confusing thing in my life for a while now.  It\u2019s almost as if it was written by the people who submit jokes to Reader\u2019s Digest.  \n\nBeyond the two biggest differences that jumped out at me, I have determined that the two are comparable.  Seinfeld is still unshaken as the best sitcom in my little book, only because I have always been so impressed with its adherence to the rule of no emotion.  I would further award the show Friends with being comparable.  Saying you like Friends more than Seinfeld is something I would now consider valid English (as opposed to saying you prefer Family Guy).\n\n![I was once in eight grade too, but you have to move on.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/familyguy.svg)\n\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion.

My life has been in boxes lately.  I have just \u2018up and left to a one bedroom bachelor pad in Rockford.\n\nNow that I think of it, there weren\u2019t many boxes involved.  I kind of just stuffed everything in the trunk of my car.  But I wanted to avoid the morbidity of saying my life has been in the trunk of a car \u2013 I can afford to exaggerate.\n\nAll settled in now.  And by that, I mean specifically that I have an Internet connection.  It was kind of an ordeal.  For three days, I writhed in data-less darkness, waiting for the hand of my new ISP to feed me.  It was a dark time, folks.  For a second, I think I almost bought a book.\n\nBut the IV line is back, and I can already feel the antibodies kicking in.  To celebrate my new screaming 5 Mb/s connection, I\u2019ve decided to put together a little IKEA Assembly Survival Guide.  The majority of my nights since the big move has been spent in instruction manuals, tiny screws, and instruction sets published by what must be the Antichrist himself.  By the time my fifth piece of furniture came together (and I had to nap from the lack of blood in my brain\u2026 that happens when I scream for longer than a few minutes), I think I had the process figured out.\n\n<br>\n\n### 1. Don\u2019t try to get too much done at once\nIKEA furniture is like alcohol \u2013 hard alcohol.  Really, that\u2019s still an understatement.  IKEA furniture should be treated like strong medication.  You should never expect to handle putting together more than one or two in a sitting.  If you try, you will only fail.  Trying to put together more than two pieces of IKEA furniture in a single night may not land you in the ER (heck \u2013 it might\u2026 I\u2019ve never tried it), but it will ensure your failure.\n\nThis is because putting IKEA furniture together is not like most activities.  It does not get easier as you practice, like bike-riding, bowling, or talking to girls.  IKEA assembly is intended to confuse you.  It will train you, challenge you, then make you doubt everything you\u2019ve done, only to repeat all of the above until you are dead.  Most people have the fortitude for about five of these cycles, which is usually covered in the assembly of three medium sized furniture pieces.  Go no further.\n\n<br>\n\n### 2. Avoid real tools\nOpening the envelope-sized box that houses your new futon only to see what looks like to be the inside of C3PO, you may be tempted to grab a box of your trusty tools.  I urge you to resist this.  In doing this, you are already making too many assumptions about the hell you are about to wade through.  By taking up your own tools, you have already decided that the job ahead can be done in the easiest way possible.  And thus begins the building of your expectations, the ridicule of your intuition, and the heart attack of doubt that washes over you.\n\nYou need to step into this like Charlie into Wonka\u2019s factory, only with much less optimism.  Be a tourist in freakville.  Take up your fetal allen wrench and ball-point pen hammer, and prepare yourself to do something very perverse.  The only way to stop the viscous cycle of entrapment is to expect to be miserable.  Think about it \u2013 what can exploit your positive attitude if you\u2019ve already murdered it?\n\n<br>\n\n### 3. Proofread the instructions\nMost think that the typical IKEA instruction manual is meant to inform you.  This is a fatal mistake.  Most people don\u2019t realize the IKEA instruction manual isn\u2019t written from the deductive perspective of, say, someone who has already assembled the item.  We cannot treat the instruction manual like a set of instructions.  If we read into it with our own contemporary interpretation, we will be left disappointing with it\u2019s fallibility.\n\nIf we are to gain anything from the included instruction manual, we are to treat it like an allegory.  The instruction manuals are written in ancient poetry.  None of the text or diagrams are meant to be taken literally.  Without an appreciation for the artful freedom of the instruction manual, it is of no use to you.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019d like to highlight that it is really of no use to you - yet.  Before you begin building your altar to the gods of chaos, be sure to spend a few hours with the manual, liberally applying your own corrections.  The manual is likely a first draft, even a scrawl or a first pitch.  Building as you read is probably the worst mistake you can make.\n\n<br>\n### 4. If you start to feel confident - don't\nLastly, resist the urge to feel confident.  The second you think to yourself \u2018Ah yes \u2013 I am getting this now\u201d, put down your tools and stop.  This is either (a) dehydration setting in or (b) an omen that you are about to do something completely wrong.  In either case, be sure to step back, rehydrate \u2013 maybe apply more gauze to your bleeding knuckles while you are up \u2013 but before you get your head back down in the grain, make sure that none of this makes any sense to you.  As long as you have lost yourself while building, you can be sure that will find yourself again when you are done.\n\n<hr>\n\nSo there are my rules of safe IKEA assembly.  If you have any IKEA stories, I\u2019d love to hear them in the comments.  Until my next post, I\u2019ll be here in my new bachelor pad eating noodles.", "description": "Having just moved in, I'd like to share my 4 rules to safely assembling Ikea furniture.", "title": "Ikea", "image_url": "http://media.alexrecker.com/images/ikea-banner.jpg", "published": true, "date": "2013-10-03", "slug": "ikea"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 11}, {"fields": {"body": "# Alex\u2019s Thoughts\n\nI first saw the film *Full Metal Jacket* about a year ago.  The movie is sort of a lot to take in, so I was grateful for a second pass.\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to say I am so grateful for anyone who serves in the military.  I couldn\u2019t imagine making the kind of sacrifice you do.  Pointing this out up front is sort of necessary, because this film casts a dark shadow on the way our country wages war.\n\nThere is a sharp crease in the middle of the movie - almost like folding a thick piece of paper in half.  The first half of the film is pure American fun.  The film opens with bushy-tailed marine recruits standing in flawless formation within crisp, clean barracks.  Though the drill sergeant is cruel, you can\u2019t help but laugh at some of the insults he comes up with.  You get a sense of the harshness of boot camp, but without a departure from good \u2018ol American fun.\n\nThe film focuses on a tubby, weak-willed recruit referred to as \u2018Private Pile\u2019 (as in, \u2018pile of sh**\u2019).  He is eager to better himself, but repeatedly falls victim to physical limitations and jelly donuts hidden in his foot locker.  But just as you would anticipate a feel-good rally, the film diverges from this American dream.  Private Pile loses his mind, and he takes the life of his drill Sergeant as well as his own.\n\nThis is where the other end of the crease starts.  The rest of the film follows a snarky military journalist through a bizarre string of personal exhibitions and harsh combat.  The film ends with a salty platoon of marines chasing a lone Viet Cong sniper through the burning refuse of a Vietnamese city, ultimately ending with the mercy killing of the sniper - a little girl all along.\n\nThe movie is a serious critique of the American military.  I interpreted the movie as a contrast of cheery Americana perspective folded over the dark reality of war.\n\nThrough a comparison of Private Pile with Private Joker, Kubrick makes a poignant statement.  It\u2019s almost as if he is saying \u2018If someone were to really take our country\u2019s propaganda seriously, this is what they would have to be - a killing machine.\u2019  Meanwhile, Kubrick expresses through Private Joker that the only way this works is if the soldiers enforce their own duality - playing along with the hollering and singing while treasuring their own cynicism and doubt.  Private Joker even mentions this *duality* when an officer questions his \u2018Born to Kill\u2019 inscription mere inches away from a peace sign pin on his uniform.\n\nSo movie that begins with breast-beating patriotism ends with the mercy killing of a child soldier - clearly progressing in the order of most-American to least.\n\nWhat do we do with this cynicism?  Are we to do away with our military all together?  This should not be the case, but we should certainly be open to questioning our country\u2019s view of itself.  Just as Private joker joked, we should always we conscious of the duality of our American identity.  In one hand, we are proud, loud Americans that have no fear.  In the other, we are thinking, reasoning citizens of the world that are deeply aware that nothing is as it seems.\n\nIf we fail to use our duality, we will find ourselves marching to the beat of our own propaganda in the most absurd of circumstances, like the closing scene of the film where the last of the platoon march through the flames chanting the words to the *Mickey Mouse* theme.\n\nBlimey - I need to cheer up.  I think I need to hit the Seinfeld reruns.\n\n# Alex\u2019s Rating\n\nSilly at first, crushing to the very end.  All I know is that I wouldn\u2019t make it five minutes in the military.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n\n# Marissa\u2019s Thoughts\n\nAlex and I continued our Stanley Kubrick marathon tonight with the war story classic Full Metal Jacket. After watching another Kubrick film, I am extremely impressed with his ability to make seemingly superficial movies contain a much deeper story. Full Metal Jacket starts out with a number of boys heading to training camp for the marines and it follows them through the struggles of preparing for the Vietnam War. Eventually the story follows them to Vietnam and into combat. \n\n\nWhen the boys are at training camp there are two privates in particular that the story emphasizes, a skinny smart-talker named the Joker, and a bigger quieter soldier named Private Pile. Private Pile constantly struggles to accomplish most of the tasks that the demanding general asks of him. Joker then does his best to help Private Pile catch up but his efforts are in vain. As the days go by we start to see Private Pile almost drift off more and more off of the training island and into his own little world. (WARNING: spoiler alert\u2026.) Eventually his brush with insanity leads him to shooting his general and then shooting himself. The story then almost immediately switches to a setting in Vietnam. But in the final scene of the film (another spoiler alert here) the Joker ends up shooting a vietnamese sniper (who had just killed three of his friends) as she is begging to be shot, wounded on the ground. \n\n\nAcknowledging Kubricks\u2019 intention of having some pretty deep lessons in his films, I began thinking about what may have been hidden in Full Metal Jacket. The first thing that struck my mind as a bit odd was the seemingly random story of the general and Private Pile. After the scene where they both die we don\u2019t hear any reference to them again. It seemed odd considering that probably half of the story\u2019s development revolved around these two characters and their tension with one another. I then began to think about the amount of sympathy I had after watching Private Pile spiral into his slightly insane state. Even though I obviously did not agree with the decisions he made, I pitied him since he had struggled to fit in and succeed. I then identified that I had not had a similar feeling during all of the line of fire shots in vietnam later in the film. So why did I feel worse when two people died than when many people had died in war in the movie? I think that it\u2019s because I felt like the story had provided a sufficient background around Private Pile that made me understand how he got to the point where he did. This then made me feel empathetic towards him. I once heard someone say that if two people die it\u2019s murder but if a thousand people die it\u2019s just a statistic. I can see what this saying is getting at. It is hard to relate to someone you have never seen, met, or even know their name. So back to Kubricks\u2019 intent. I think that he was trying to play on this common understanding by creating some ironic relatability. By feeling sad when Private Pile and the general died in the beginning, shouldn\u2019t we feel just as bad, or worse, when an event where thousands of people have died? I personally think that this is a good idea for anyone to sit on for a bit, including myself. Even though it is hard to relate to events that happen thousands of miles away, that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t care. \n\n\nOverall I did enjoy this film and would rate it a solid 7/10 for it\u2019s interesting setting change and it\u2019s ability to blend together a story of a boy in training camp with a story of his friends fighting in the Vietnam war. \n\n# Marissa\u2019s Rating\n\nThis movie is yet another beautiful Kubrick film, intertwining deep messages into a seemingly superficial war story.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>", "description": "Marissa and I review the movie Full Metal Jacket, and we try not to get all sad about it.

Since it is technically just a collection links to other websites, you could say that I visit *a lot* of places on the web.  This may be true, but it all begins with reddit.com\n\nReddit is simply a place to post links.  People who post need accounts, and people with accounts can provide feedback in the form of positive and negative votes.  The highest voted links bubble to the top, and the lowest fall to the bottom.  When this is practiced on a huge scale, what you get is a bustling website where at any given time, you can view the top 100 or so coolest things on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the site provides a comment forum underneath each link.  The comments function the same way.  They are voteable, and the highest comments float to the top.  Naturally, at any given time in a thread the *most* poignant or funny comment in the whole batch is readily available at the top.\n\n*Subreddits* are interest-based groups on Reddit.  They are moderated by the users that created them (and *anyone* can create one).  They decide on what their group is all about, and people who share their interest can *subscribe* to the subreddit.\n\nBut there are plenty of places you can read about how Reddit works.  In fact, I really should have just pointed you toward this video, which does a much better job explaining things than I do.\n\n<br>\n<div class=\"container-fluid text-center\">\n<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>\n<iframe class='embed-responsive-item' src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tlI022aUWQQ\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n\nSo there is your summary of Reddit.  I can imagine that when the website first got going in June of 2005, it was a pretty rad little e-hole in the wall.  But sadly, as it grew to be one of the most visited active websites, some couldn't see past the website\u2019s value as just another *marketing opportunity*.  I get nauseous whenever I come across a blog post titled something like *The Secret to Getting TONS of Web Traffic from Reddit*.\n\n![It\u2019s kind of like Facebook, only with fewer icebucket challenge videos](http://www.linkbuildr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/reddit-Screenshot.png)\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back, dear reader - and the only way I really know how to combat misinformation is with education.  Here are **five things to keep in mind to market on Reddit - and *not* be a dick.**\n\n# 1. You actually have to be a *redditor*\n\nYou have to make an account to post or comment on anything.  There\u2019s not much to it.  It\u2019s your typical silly username + password + optional email verification.\n\nAt this point in the Reddit immigration, idiot marketing guys choose a name like *StupidTechBlog_CheckForUpdates* or *ZING_marketing*.  To cite Reddit\u2019s sitewide rules,\n\n> It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account.\n\nI\u2019d say calling your new user account \u2018HipNewWebsite\u2019 to advertise your hip new website is not really a great start.  Make a username that you actually like.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell you why, but there are a number of running jokes when it comes to usernames.  One trend dictates that they be (1) in all caps (2) word delimited by underscores (3) depicting something horribly gruesome or crass.  I suppose it\u2019s so we can witness these types of wonderful exchanges:\n\n> ```POTATO_IN_MY_BUTT``` Hey guys, I\u2019m going through a hard time now.  The girl I have been in love with forever has just confessed to me that she struggles with depression.  How do I handle this?\n\n> ```BEAR_CIRCUMCISER``` Don\u2019t catch yourself letting your feelings affect your counsel.  It would probably be best to talk to one of her friends just to make sure you stay honest and unbiased.\n\n> ```CLOWN_PEDOPHILE``` BEAR_CIRCUMCISER is right.  It sounds like she is in no condition to begin a relationship anyway.\n\nIsn\u2019t it wonderful?  I\u2019ve read a totally illuminating breakdown on the ENRON scandal from a guy who went by MIDGET_PUNCHER.  Reading something interesting and thoughtful from a twisted username never gets old.\n\n# 2. Comment on things that don\u2019t have to do with you\n\nOne of the first things a redditor will probably do when they come across someone is look at their comment history - especially if you are buying something from them or exchanging services.\n\nSome users do nothing but piss people off.  They leave horrible degrading comments in the most innocent of threads.  A good tipoff to one of these guys is that their comment history is filled with nothing but mean, banned, and poorly voted comments.\n\nLikewise, if you have nothing in your comment history but comments about your product, you are going to look by a spammer.  Believe it or not, a comment history like this is grounds for permanent banning from the site.  You have to mix things up a bit.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get a decent comment history going is through /r/AskReddit.  It\u2019s simply a subreddit for people to post general questions in hopes of a ton of redditors answering in the comments.  For now, don\u2019t try to get in on the 2000-3000 pointers on the front page.  Click the \u2018new\u2019 tab at the top to see the questions that are just flowing in.  They may be strange, poorly worded, and hopeless when it comes to getting to the front page - but they usually get at least a dozen comments.  Answer as many as you want to.  When you get a reply, follow up.  Be brief and \u2018laid back\u2019, since the stakes aren\u2019t really that high in the new section.\n\nSometimes while commenting it\u2019s tempting to get in fights with people.  You may delude yourself into thinking you will look really awesome if you *win*, but nobody really wins an Internet fight, do they?  Fights are petty and make for terrible threads.  Let things roll of your back.  If someone *zings* you and their hurtful comment is getting upvoted, it\u2019s probably just that you are in the wrong subreddit.\n\nUse your brain.  Don\u2019t try to crack a joke in /r/AskScience.  Don\u2019t make fun of Christians in /r/christianity.  Just find a more appropriate subreddit for your views, and your witty self will be ruling that subreddit\u2019s frontpage in no time.\n\n# 3. Respect the moderators.  Ask them before doing stuff\n\nSo you are getting pretty comfortable with Reddit at this point.  You are getting to the point where you want to make a post about a product of yours.\n\nBefore you slap in with your shameless advertisement, **message the subreddit\u2019s moderators**.  There is an envelope icon toward the right of every subreddit.  Clicking it initiates a private message to the people that run that subreddit.\n\nPolitely explain who you are, what your product is, then ask if you can post about it.  If you cannot, a good moderator will guide you to a more appropriate subreddit.\n\nEach subreddit has rules too.  They are kept in the sidebar.  Most subreddits even have bots that automatically remove links that don\u2019t follow rules, so make sure your review them before posting anything.\n\n![This link may as well say \u2018Do the right Thing\u2019](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/messageTheModerators.png)\n\n# 4. Don\u2019t \u2018pitch\u2019.  Just talk.\n\nFinally.  Here is the great secret to getting a ton of hits from Reddit.  Are you ready?\n\n1. Have a great idea\n2. Don\u2019t be a tool\n\nThe truth is that there is no secret.  If you have a great idea, it will do great there.  If it doesn\u2019t, take it to another subreddit.  Also, don\u2019t be a tool.  Nobody will give a snobbish pitch the time of day.\n\nYou have probably heard of *Imgur*.  It\u2019s a massive image hosting site.  Not many people may know that it was created *for reddit*.  The site was announced by ```MrGrim``` in a simple post titled *My Gift to Reddit: I created an image hosting service that doesn't suck. What do you think?*\n\nYou can read the thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting).\n\nThere was no marketing material or *viral* video.  It was just some dude who was fed up with all the other image hosts and set out to make one that *didn\u2019t suck*.\n\nI guess this section should be relabeled *Make sure your idea doesn\u2019t suck*.\n\n# Closing\n\nIf you are a vibrant, tan marketing *guru* who is trying to \u2018crack Reddit\u2019, I would start with dampening that mohawk of yours.  Not seeing the site as a web traffic pi\u00f1ata is the secret, you cologne-covered nimrod.\n\nAnd to the rest of you - especially if you don\u2019t have a marketing bone in your body - there is still plenty for you on [reddit](http://reddit.com).  Come hang out with ```MAKES_OUT_WITH_HORSES``` and others like him.\n\nGoodnight, readership.  Peace.", "description": "I have had it with all those flashy marketing sites claiming they know how to get traffic from Reddit.  There is some serious misinformation out there.

I had no idea what to expect, and - in a way - I still have no idea what I\u2019ve just watched.  I had to take some extra time to digest this movie.\n\nClockwork Orange was intense, provocative, and cryptic.  It follows a teenage boy through a dystopia future, detailing his obsession with sex and violence.  While out on one of his capers, Alex is betrayed by his friends and nabbed by the police.  He effortlessly demonstrates his charisma in prison, which attracts the attention of a shady doctor who offers to heal him of his \u2018violence addiction\u2019.\n\nAlex happily agrees and is subjected to a week of graphic films and induced nausea.  When the experiment concludes, he is left broken and depressed, helpless against a wave of reflex sickness when he looks at a women or is confronted with violence.  It eventually takes a failed suicide attempt for the doctors to recollect Alex and reverse the treatment.\n\n![There were also plenty of scenes that made me feel like I was watching Jackass](http://www.collativelearning.com/PICS%20FOR%20WEBSITE/ACO%20expanded/dvd%20stills%202/marina%20fight.png)\n\nNormally in movies, books, and cartoons we are taught that there are two kinds of desires.  There\u2019s the finer part of you, and the animal in you.  The finer part of you likes jazz, fresh salads, and reading.  The animal in you likes fart jokes, drinking way too much beer, and flexing in the mirror.\n\n![I\u2019m sorry, but the part of you that enjoys Nickleback is mental illness.](http://www.greatplainsexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nickelback-3576.jpg)\n\nFor as long as I can remember I have been under the impression that my desires split at this fork in the road.  But watching this movie was the first time I\u2019ve been brought to challenge that assumption.\n\nWhat if, as Kubrick teases, there is basically *one* type of desire?  What if the same part of you that enjoys your dad\u2019s old Coltrane tapes is fundamentally the same part of you that enjoys popping a really big blister?  What if an art student admiring the *Mona Lisa* is no different that one monkey admiring another\u2019s fecal smearing?  What if we are all basically animals?\n\nThis is how I view Alex.  He is a human being given the power to see through this false dichotomy.  To him, watching a naked women frolic in his bedroom is appreciated with the same fervor as the masterpiece of Beethoven\u2019s ninth.\n\nOK - take the art in the movie.  Everybody\u2019s home is shamelessly decorated with gratuitously sexual art (exaggerated breasts, graphic sex scenes, sculpted genitals, etc).  I don\u2019t think Kubrick was just trying to be weird.\n\nI think the paintings looked different exclusively to Alex.  The home owners in the movie would have defended their innocence -  \u201cI like the colors and textures,\u201d - that kind of thing.\n\n*But Alex thinks this is hilarious.*  At one point in the movie, he even picks up a large statue of a phallus and jeers at the homeowner, \u201cNaughty Naughty!\u201d  It\u2019s as if Alex saw right through her claim to *fine taste* and was mocking the real reason she was drawn to piece.\n\nThere is another scene where Alex is grossly fascinated with the Bible.  Though the reverend praises him for his piety, we see that Alex is simply drawn to the sex and violence littered throughout all of Scripture.  Again, he is seeing the *real* reason people pick up the Bible.\n\nThe offensive suggestion here is that there are no *finer* tastes.  There is only one type of desire.  We are just animals wandering a big jungle, surrounding ourselves with things that arouse us.  And if that were really true, every piece of art might as well be a giant phallus.\n\nIt\u2019s a dark perspective, but we can take a minute to appreciate the challenge.  Think about it - if someone studied your attraction to your husband or wife and hypothesized that it\u2019s simply a chemical attraction, would you be able to prove them wrong?\n\nClockwork Orange makes a crisis out of something too many people take for granted.  We proudly defend our humanity saying, \u201cLook!  I can choose what I do!\u201d  But examining this with the same suspicion Alex had, we really don\u2019t have any choice at all.  We can either give ourselves pleasure, or withhold ourselves pleasure.  We cannot change *what* gives us pleasure.  If that were true, by the film\u2019s standards, \u2018A man that cannot choose is not really a man at all.\u2019\n\nIf we cannot change what gives us pleasure, then what is really that moral about simply withholding pleasure?  I\u2019m thinking of the moment when the scientists parade the \u201ccured\u201d prisoner in front of an audience.  They marvel as a naked woman flaunts herself in front of Alex, but he is too sick to lay a finger on her.  Meanwhile, everyone in the audience is free to stare at her beauty.\n\nThe film is very dirty, but does a great job of equivocating the classical sense of morality over a back drop of visually fascinating screen work.\n\n# Alex\u2019s Rating\n\nExcellent film, as long as you don\u2019t mind a bit of the \u2018ol ultra violence.\n(I think I\u2019m also going to be stuck on the \u201c*little bit of the \u2018ol*\u201d thing for a while.  I can\u2019t stop saying it).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n\n# Marissa's Thoughts\n\nAlex and I were particularly excited when the movie A Clockwork Orange was next up in our list of Kubrick movies. The little we knew about the movie was that it is particularly odd and quirky. After just finishing Barry Lyndon, we were excited for some classic Kubrick weirdness. After watching A Clockwork Orange we were definitely not disappointed. \n\nWhile watching the movie it seemed like at every turn was something unexplained or unexpected. It left quite a lot to process and try to dissect to find Kubricks intentions. But, there was one scene in particular in the film that I based most of my understanding of the movie off of. There was a moment when the main character Alex was in his room. On his wall there was a rather errotic painting and below the painting was his pet snake sitting on a branch hung on the wall. But below that was a small sculpture of four Jesus figures with their arms around one another. I couldn\u2019t help but think that this must be symbolic. The painting on the wall was at the highest point of the symbolic hierarchy, which I assumed represented the desires of man, then next was the snake, which I assumed represented Satan and sin, and finally were the four Jesus figures, representing goodness, purity, and godliness. This theme seemed to continue throughout the rest of the film. The most important component of each character's life seemed to be their sexuality and their desires based on the physicality of the people around them. This was sadly clear after several rape scenes in the film. Then it seemed that the second most significant component of each characters\u2019 lives were any other desires and finally, last on the totem pole, was anything that involved benefiting the people around them. \n\nThis flip in significance of the various parts of life relates to the other main point that I got from this movie. This second point is the question of what truly makes a man moral, or how do we define the morality of man. This movie creatively forces that question upon the audience after portraying a character as immoral and then making they seem moral and vise versa. There is also a large portion of the movie dedicated to an experiment that tries to use science as a way to make an  immoral person moral. The character Alex finds himself in jail and then in the experimental process of correcting him into being a decent human being. What the film ends up with is that science was not able to ultimately be the decider in whether or not a man is moral. But the question of what truly does make human beings moral or immoral is something that you will have to decide for yourselves after seeing A Clockwork Orange. \n\n# Marissa's Rating\n\nA Clockwork Orange is a beautiful film with fantastic music, fantastic acting, and an extremely creative story that asks one of the most profound questions possible for humanity. Overall I think i\u2019ll have to agree with Alex that the movie is a 10/10.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>", "description": "Time for a bit of the \u2018ol Kubrick Week, eh readers?

Wearing glasses on your face that double as a smart phone.  It\u2019s certainly the most idealistic product pitch I have seen in a while.  Imagine \u2013 seamlessly integrating your rich digital life with your vibrant, adventurous social life with a gadget fit for 007.\n\nAllow me to clear the air \u2013 I don\u2019t like it.  I\u2019ll qualify my opinion by illuminating that I am no longer a googlist (I was trying to conjugate that like the word racist, but whatever).  I used to hate everything that came out of google\u2019s tower.  Why I finally started swallowing their possessive horse pills is another long conversation altogether (and a conversation that is actually pretty easy to tease out of me).  The point is that I am no longer an anti-google hippie.  I use gmail, chrome, hangouts \u2013 I\u2019m even hip with the whole Google Docs thing.\n\nEven with my recent google-flavored indulgences in my tech diet, glass does not sit well with me.\n\nNo \u2013 it\u2019s not because of the whole give the already creepy guy an even more stealthy camera than his phone threat that presents itself (I could just here that same tagline of \u201cGlass, take a video!\u201d over the screams of a girl\u2019s locker room).\n\nIn fact, even the early customer prototypes of Glass have provoked privacy-related [concerns from Congress](http://www.fastcompany.com/3009432/tech-forecast/tracking-the-ban-on-google-glass).\n\nWhat offends me is how the whole project carries itself like a revolution of communication.  Computerworld reported:\n\n> People new to wearing computers on their faces are walking around the conference center, exaggeratedly nodding their heads to activate the devices, and taking pictures and video. They\u2019re also reading email, checking weather reports and reviewing flight schedules \u2014 all without taking their smartphones out of their pockets.\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve had this sense of freedom,\u201d said Kelly Merrell, director of Android development for Mercury Intermedia. \u201cI realized that with all the notifications I get, I had to keep pulling my phone out and checking it. Now it\u2019s no longer an issue. It\u2019s made me feel less reliant on my phone.\u201d\n\nTrue \u2013 the user no longer needs to look down to communicate by text message\u2026as long as you don\u2019t need to respond to them either.  Check the weather, sports, and email all you want, but at some point you are going to have to actually respond to someone.  Nothing has changed, after all.  There is still going to be a tiny keyboard between you and someone else.\n\nSo am I worried about seeing these things everywhere?  Here is my prediction \u2013 I would be surprised if I saw one outside of San Francisco.  It may be a thrilling new piece of technology that makes you feel like a crewman of the Starship Enterprise, but allow me to haunt you with another face-wearable device that was also supposed to revolutionize the way we communicate.\n\n![Hi there.  I was hoping the blinking light on my face would make me seem more driven and connected.  Also, it is pronounced POR-SHUH.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bluetoothguy.gif)\n\nSo that is my piece.  I think you will see some idiot wearing these glasses just about as often as you see a bluetooth headset.  In the meantime, we should try to keep the first adopters of Glass out of our locker rooms.\n\nIn a bit of fun, here is a video showing what a Microsoft spin on things would look like.\n\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UGQkB_21heU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "description": "Official Promotional video for Google Glass, released this past February.

They are insane \u2013 and they also currently handle my email for me.\n\n*Ars Technica* writes:\n\n> Many months after the release of Google Glass to developers and early-adopters, Google is finally starting to suss out the inherent social awkwardness of the product. The company has released an official set of do\u2019s and dont\u2019s for participants in the Explorer program, some of which amount to a reminder that manners and basic courtesy still exist for the technologically elite.\n\nAn official set of [\u201cdo\u2019s and dont\u2019s\u201d](https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers).  My god \u2013 I can hardly wait.\n\nBefore I walk you through the most arrogant document ever released, let me first say that I have been perched at the edge of my [HISSMON](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10263779/) eagerly awaiting Google\u2019s official response to months of public torment for their serious undertaking of the controversial faceputer.\n\nHalf of me expected a cute webpage with a simple \u201cOops!  We\u2019re going to go on to something a little more helpful.\u201d  The other half of me expected this kind of document.  See, being around engineers a lot, I have started to notice how much energy we waste trying to convince the user that they are wrong.  Whenever a product is returned to the drawing board, every egghead in the room needs to pass through all the stages of grief before they can even consider opening up the hood again.  I find it funny, but equally humbling.  I\u2019m already starting to notice that I do the same.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/dora.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Now that Google refers to Glass-wearers as \u201cExplorers\u201d, the Dora chatroom I moderate has descended into chaos.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Engineers are wrong\nEvery couple argues.  At least once a month, I find myself stoking petty flames between me and my SO by exercising a faulty assumption.  *She\u2019s not really frustrated with you.  You just need to explain to her that she is not upset*.  If you are taken back by how preposterous that is, then congratulations \u2013 there is still hope for you.  You may after all live a happy life of effortless human interface.  For any engineers reading this, I\u2019m going to be honest with you \u2013 that statement was supposed to sound ridiculous.  You can\u2019t convince people that they are not really frustrated.  That is one thing they will always be right about.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/clippy.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>\"I see you are trying to be passive aggressive.

They just aren\u2019t using it right.  We need to explain to people how to behave in public*.\n\nAnd so begins the circus of the official Google do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.  I have linked to it, but I also pasted it into notepad, fearing Google would wake from its fitfull stupour and take the announcement down.  Yes \u2013 it\u2019s that bad.\n\n<br>\n\n### The DONT'S of Wearing Glass\n\n<br>\n\n> DON\u2019T Glass-out. Glass was built for short bursts of information and interactions that allow you to quickly get back to doing the other things you love. If you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you\u2019re probably looking pretty weird to the people around you. So don\u2019t read War and Peace on Glass. Things like that are better done on bigger screens.\n\nIn other words, do you see that shiny glistening computer screen?  Of course you do \u2013 it\u2019s covering up half of your eyeball.  Try not to stare at it.  You may glance at it now and then for \u201cshort bursts of time\u201d, but don\u2019t stare.  Just behave how you would normally around a solar eclipse.  Remember \u2013 although Google made Glass to help you better maintain personal communication with others around while still keeping your digital communication active, you are going to have to behave a little differently when things are hovering menacingly in peripheral vision.  I will reiterate \u2013 in order to reap the intended benefit of Glass, you are going to have to change your behavior.\n\n<br>\n\n>DON\u2019T Rock Glass while doing high-impact sports. Glass is a piece of technology, so use common sense. Water skiing, bull riding or cage fighting with Glass are probably not good ideas.\n\n<br>\n\nI know seeing the commercials of people [frolicking in hot air balloons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Gwb61aAq4), riding roller coasters, doing gymnastics, and skydiving may have gotten you a little excited, but you are most definitely going to have to give up your previous life of high impact sports.  You do want to rock Glass, right?  Then give it a rest with all the moving around.  After all, you are basically wearing an unprotected, expensive smart phone high up on your body.  Beyond all the sports, you better not go anywhere dangerous either.  There\u2019s no stopping anyone from just [yanking that pretty little machine right of your face and taking off down the street](http://betabeat.com/2013/11/police-say-some-dude-got-his-google-glass-stolen-in-brooklyn/).  When in rough areas, you better place glass in your pocket right next to your smartphone.  Does Glass actually make phone calls yet?  Can we confirm that?  I will reiterate, Glass is intended to make your life easier.  But you are going to have to live a bit less on the active side if you want to reap the immense benefits of Glass.\n\n<br>\n\n>DON\u2019T Wear it and expect to be ignored. Let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re gonna get some questions. Be patient and explain that Glass has a lot of the same features as a mobile phone (camera, maps, email, etc.). Also, develop your own etiquette. If you\u2019re worried about someone interrupting that romantic dinner at a nice restaurant with a question about Glass, just take it off and put it around the back of your neck or in your bag.\n\n<br>\n\nWe at Google are just going to be brutally honest here.  We wanted Glass to enhance the way you talk to your friends.  We want you to be able to read a tweet, check your email, and get right back to talking with your buddy all without taking your eyes away from the conversation.\n\nBut people are going to treat you differently.  Some people just won\u2019t understand how much easier it is to focus on what your are saying to them, even though you are equipped with a faceputer.\n\nSo you are going to have to improvise a bit.  Since they will just be focused on the fact that you are wearing a computer on your face, you had better just talk about it.  Show them all the things you can do with Glass all without removing your lifeless, dead face from the dull conversation about your new toy.  I will reiterate \u2013 in order to enhance the way you talk to people, you are going to have to talk about Glass.\n\nAnd in the rare occurrence that you and your glass-sporting self are anywhere romantic, you had better just take it off.  Place it in your bag with all of your other electronics \u2013 you know \u2013 where society has decided it is ok for them to reside while you are interfacing with humans.  I will reiterate \u2013 Glass is intended to enhance all meaningful relationships you will have with human beings, but if you perchance find yourself in a conversation that is far too meaningful for Glass, remove it from your face temporarily.  Also, you should think about removing that relationship from your life.  Clearly, it is disrupting your new social glass-driven workflow.\n\n<br>\n\n> DON\u2019T Be creepy or rude (aka, a \u201cGlasshole\u201d). Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don\u2019t get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren\u2019t allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you\u2019re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.\n\n<br>\n\nAhhhhhhhhhhh.  I can\u2019t do it anymore.  I can\u2019t stay in character.  You have GOT to be kidding me.  I cannot believe this thing is real.  This is the part in the document that I expected to be part of an elaborate Jimmy Kimmel prank to be revealed next week.\n\nNOT ONLY did Google have the audacity to recognize the existence of the mocking coinage of \u201cGlasshole\u201d, but they were so smug to even misquote it.\n\nNo, Google.  A glasshole isn\u2019t someone who wears Glass AND continuously exhibits rude and creepy behavior.\n\nA glasshole is simply someone who dared to wear Glass in public.  No one spots a Glass-wearer and says *Hey \u2013 that guy is wearing Glass.  Let\u2019s watch him for a minute and see if he behaves rudely \u2013 then he is most certainly a Glasshole*.  You have already spotted one.\n\nGoogle \u2013 if you are going to own up to the satire out there, make sure next time you digest it completely.  They actually took the time to contort the slang into a more corporate friendly meaning.\n\n<br>\n\n### Papa Google may be getting senile\nSo what happened?  I will enforce here that I am not a negative-nancy.  Google is great when it is good.  But after the systematic rape of the YouTube community, the gunpoint exodus to a cardboard Google+ community, and now this delusional \u201cfix\u201d to Glass\u2019s lack of popularity, I can hear the funeral dirge with unmistakable pitch-perfect clarity.  I believe Google is growing senile.  As their backlog of solutions still in need of problems piles up, it\u2019s becoming clear that Google no longer knows what real problems look like.\n\nWhen Google started as a company, it was all about fixing problems for people.  I saw Google as a young, ambitous company who sought to make searching the vast web easier for people.  When they grew unhappy with the way email was done, they continued to shake the tech landscape up and rolled their own wildly useful Gmail.  When Google grew unhappy with the selection of tools to browse the web, they bravely launched Chrome, which I still happily use for personal web browing myself.  For years, Google was a breathe of fresh air in relieving the real frustration of real people.  It was easy to get excited about whatever they were working on.\n\nBut in aging, greying years the questions Google was asking started to feel much less relevant.  How can a Gmail user interact with their Google+ profile?  How can a YouTube user post to their Google+ through their Google phone?  How can a Hangouts user hangout with Gmail users?   Things don\u2019t even make sense anymore.  Can we hang it up with all the nauseating and obtrusive hurdles for the sake of brand-name integration?\n\nWhat I fear is happening with Google is that it has lost touch with real people.  What makes me say that?  Too many of their ideas are pungent with that overpowering board-room smell.  There are too many investments in bad ideas to allow anything to fail.  Consequently, Google has to convince us that they we are not actually frustrated with them.  We are just using things wrongly.  If Google decides how we should use their products, than why would we even be interested in the first place?\n\nGoogle continues to confuse me.  I hope for their sake that I am not the only one to ridicule the decision to publish *The Do's and Don't of Glass*.", "description": "Google released an official list of \"do's and don'ts\" for Glass wearers.

That\u2019s what I promised this week.\n\nBut I lost interest at this point.  That\u2019s what usually happens when I get a full seven hours a sleep.  I wake up with a totally new positive outlook on things.  To the angry mob of YouTubers pining for a televised murder of a Google executive, my advice to you is to do the same.  Just sleep off the disappointment.  By the time you wake up, Google will be as out-of-touch with real people as Microsoft is, and you\u2019ll feel a lot better.\n\nAnd truth be told, I was really only writing it for one person I had in mind.  Well rather than boring you all with a broad sea of text to skim, how about we move on with our lives.\n\nAnd to you, my Google-loving heel, you see me after class ;)\n\nOn to something different.  This week is a recipe.\n\n<br>\n\n### You have to twitch before you can crawl\nIf you have ever spent any time with my family, you should know that my parents love to cook.  It\u2019s not just mac \u2018n chees \u2018n tots \u2018n casserole either \u2013 I\u2019m talking real gourmet stuff.  In our house growing up, cedar plank salmon was a Thursday.  Additionally, our spice cabinet was bigger than my book shelf, I think.\n\nAll that to say, now responsible for feeding myself, I have absolutely no idea what I am doing.  Launching into Apartment life, in this regard, was like stepping off a shuttle after a long stint in space.  I felt throbbing in muscles that had been long-lost to atrophe.  For the first time in my life, the pang of hunger wasn\u2019t going to be followed by a crab cake.  I grew up without ever paying attention to anything.  I knew nothing of what happened before things hit the plate.  I no longer had an ambassador between me and Trader Joe\u2019s.  I was useless.\n\nGiven my handicap, I feel I have a unique perspective on cooking.  I decided to learn brutally.  Feed yourself with what you know, and then let your stomach tell you what to make next.  In other words, learn to twitch before you learn to crawl (and the misquote of the popular maxim was intentional, because what I know now hardly deserves to be compared to crawling).\n\nIt\u2019s been a painful first few weeks living off of Ramen, oven pizza, and sunflower seeds, but I think my plan is working.  My meals are slowly gaining some respectable complexity, all driven behind my adopted mantra, \u201cThere is no ignorance in discovery\u201c.  In other words, I\u2019m trying not to rely on other people so much for recipes and advice.  If something is really a bad idea, then it will be obvious.  After all, I\u2019m the one who has to choke it down.  I\u2019m trying to let the ideas do the talking.\n\nNow, I am proud to present to you my first meal.  To give tribute to it\u2019s rich lineage of soggy prototypes and kitchen meta-fires, I call it the \u201cMiss-Steak\u201d.\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\n### Building the Miss-Steak\n<br>\n#### Ingredients\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n        \t<img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/cheapsteaks.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <p>1.

Whatever <em>this</em> thing is.</p>\n            \t<small>It\u2019s ninety pounds, impossible to clean, and it scares the hell out of raw meat</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n\nNow that the gang\u2019s all assembled, it\u2019s time to make a grown man\u2019s meal.  Go ahead and rip open the steaks.  Don\u2019t worry about the smell \u2013 we\u2019re hopefully going to fix that.  For less than three bucks per steak, I\u2019m just assuming they\u2019re doing the bear minimum to make this thing technically edible.\n\nNow slap it down on a plate.  This is where you are going to need all the sprinkly stuff out of your cabinet.  I take a minute to shake everything onto each steak, following one general rule: the amount of spice you use from the container should be governed by the size of the container itself.  For example, I have no idea what cumin is, but because the container is smaller than a tic-tac box, I\u2019m going to treat it like it\u2019s really precious (the spice gets bonus points for counter-intuitive spelling too).\n\nGet it nice and\u2026 powdery\u2026 after all the spice is applied (more specifically, salt, garlic salt, pepper, cumin, chile powder, and basil), give the meat a nice, aggressive rubdown.  I picture it like I\u2019m a medic from Saving Private Ryan trying to pinch off a spurting artery.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/rubbingmeat.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>If you\u2019d like to add to the analogy, you can bark coordinates over your shoulder, and wonder out loud \u201cWhere the hell is my airstrike?\u201d</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nNext, you want to let the meat sit and get down to room temperature.  This usually happens in the time frame of two grand theft auto shooting sprees.  When it\u2019s ready to go, drop your enormous red salvaged-from-a-helicopter-cockpit griddle-pan onto the stove, add a little oil, and start heating.\n\nWhile that\u2019s getting happy, I cut the vegetables.  I don\u2019t have any insight into how to cut vegetables.  It kind of just devolves into savage ripping and tearing.  If I have a hard time getting the stems off, I might even cry a little.\n\nBy now, your freak-griddle should be ready to bring the pain.  Grab the steak and drop it across the merciless grooves.  \n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/layingmeat.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nDo it quick, because hell soon-after flies forth from the grill.  I swear those drops of oil go for the face like a heat-seeking missile.  Seriously, it makes a big mess.  My first instinct was to grab a spatula and move it around, but you just need to let the metal and the meat work out their differences.  I should mention that if you ever feel the need to do something with your hands (like if someone is watching you cook, and you feel you would lose their trust if they saw your arms at your side while flames and hot oil lick the air, put a little pot of water on the stove and stir it occasionally).\n\nNow that the steak is on the heat, don\u2019t touch it for another three minutes.  The impression I get with steak is that it is really important that you only flip steak once.  Take the opportunity to get the vegetables going.  If the butter turns brown, and then hisses at you, that means you burned it.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/dumpingveggies.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n \n\nIf someone is watching you do this over your shoulder, just calmly dump the refuse in the sink and prelude your next attempt with \u201c\u2026 now that the pan is deglazed\u2026\u201d  Do not offer an explanation for what \u201cdeglazed\u201d means, because we don\u2019t know.  It was just meant to disarm the situation.\n\nIt might be time to turn the steak over.  I really don\u2019t know when.  I know how to fake it though \u2013 poke at it, look at it from an angle, hold your thumb up to it, count out loud in your head\u2026 just do something to make it look like you are being a decisive chef.  The nice thing about beef is that, no matter when you stop cooking it, there is someone on the planet that prefers to eat it like that.\n\nIf you turned at the right time, the bottom of the steak is going to be golden brown, crispy, juicy, and tread with defined grill marks.  It kind of reminds me of the base of my toilet right now, come to think of it.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/grillingmeat.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nDo the same thing for the other side. You would have to, wouldn\u2019t you?  That\u2019s not even cooking\u2026 that\u2019s just the principles of symmetry.\n\nAll throughout, give the veggies a poke every now and then \u2013 half for just the sake of keeping your hands busy.  When in doubt, just add more butter.  Butter saves most bad inventions in the kitchen.  I suspect even a cup of broken glass, if well-buttered, wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world for at least the first few bites.\n\nAt this point, both the veggies and the steak should be nearing completion.  Before you pack them away, go shut your smoke detector off.  Don\u2019t be alarmed if you didn\u2019t hear it \u2013 it\u2019s probably just the fumes from your poorly ventilated apartment stove getting to your head.\n\nLastly, throw a couple of slices of bread on the griddle where the steak last left off.  Anything with those grill lines brazed on it, no matter how meaningless and last minute they are, taste more delicious than without.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/hotbread.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<small>Now this is definitely going to set off the smoke detector. Maybe even the carbon monoxide detector if you are using the right kind of bread.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nWhen you are all done, turn everything off and scrap the whole greasy vegetable-meat mess onto one delicious sandwich, and optionally serve alongside some effeminate sweet potato fries (just to counteract all the manliness).\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/forgotthecheese.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n            \t<small>Oh\u2026 forgot the cheese.

Growing up in the world of Dateline NBC, The View, and whatever that bizarre semi regular cabal that can be seen on Fox News is, I have noticed one thing that has faithfully held back my parents\u2019 generation from judging the role of video games in a child\u2019s life fairly.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/foxandfriends.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Fox and Friends: By paranoid baby boomers, for paranoid baby boomers</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\nNo one in my parents\u2019 generation who speaks with authority actually knows what they mean when they say \u201cvideo games\u201d.\n\nAnd the reason why it\u2019s so difficult to convince this generation of this is because they really think they do know.  All because they had an Atari wired up to their living room TV and played Pong for about 20 minutes a week, they think they can, not only voice their opinion concerning the  effect of modern video games in society, but actually lead the discussion.\n\nThe video games of this time are about as relevant to the discussion as hop-scotch or \u201cI-Spy\u201d is.  The fact is that video games are completely different today.  Anyone who  gave up the gamer life before the Super Nintendo effectively surrendered their right talk about how they think Call of Duty is affecting our kids.\n\nI know I am coming on a bit strong with the sweeping statements, but they are rightfully sweeping.  In all my years of playing video games, not once have I come across a parent who appreciated the different types of video games that are out there.  Which leads into my first bit of advice\u2026\n\n\n### 1. Know what kind of video games your kid play\nWhen I said I have never met an adult who appreciated the difference between video games, I wasn\u2019t being totally truthful.  I\u2019ve met one person.  It was late in junior high, and after participating in sufficient, cordial dinner table conversation with our extended family, I escaped into the basement to play Xbox.  I powered on the machine and picked up on where I had last left off.  I was playing through one of the Splinter Cell games, which I was very fond of at the time.\n\nTo my shame, just as my character was seconds from assasinating the impetus of a dangerous revolution in *Tblilisi, Georgia*, I noticed my Auntie Bonnie standing over my shoulder.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sneak up you, Alex.  Just watching \u2013 that\u2019s all.  What are you doing?\u201d\n\nI offered her only as much detail as I thought she was interested in.  \u201dJust playing video games.\u201d  We sat there in silence for a few more minutes.  I pulled the trigger, sending a titanium round cleanly through the skull of the villain I had been dutifully watching in my long-ranged scope.  Then, my aunt surprised me.\n\n\u201cSo tell me about this character.  Which country is this?  Who sent you there?\u201d\n\nSheepish at first, I delved into a little more detail.  \u201dWell\u2026 I\u2019m Sam Fischer.  He\u2019s been through a lot of wars, but he keeps getting pulled from retirement because he\u2019s the best of the best.  The NSA sends him into conflict areas because they know he can\u2026 make problems go away, I guess.  He\u2019s like a machine \u2013 he just gets the job done, no matter how stacked the situation is.\u201d\n\nBonnie nodded in approval.  \u201dThat\u2019s cool.  Nice shot \u2013 that looked pretty hard.\u201d  Bonnie stood and watched until Sam climbed into an extraction helicopter.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/samfischer.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>I waited until she walked away to throw my celebratory grenades all over the civilian town.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\nI was impressed, and I think most parents could learn a valuable lesson from Bonnie.  The fact is that video games are very different, and more so every day.  If you don\u2019t believe me, just take a guy who plays Madden all day and send him on a little playdate with your typical World of Warcraft guy, and just watch how much they like each other (spoiler \u2013 the Madden guy asks the other what sports World of Warcraft guy likes, and the World of Warcraft guy just stares at his shoes until he walks away.\n\nVideo games are different.  You can\u2019t really talk about how \u201cVideo Games\u201d are affecting your kids until you know what kind of video games they play \u2013 and how do you sleuth it out?  Just as my Auntie Bonnie did, you simply ask them.\n\nSure \u2013 letting your swarthy son talk about what level magii he is in virtual-weirdo land may be the most boring five minutes of your life, but just watch him light up at the prospect of his parents actually caring about his interest.  They may be boring, time-consuming, and radically different from how you used to spend your time, but they are still interests nonetheless.\n\nHow can this make your relationship between you and your kid better?  You build trust.  Getting banned from your favorite hobby sucks, but knowing that my parents took the time to actually familiarize themselves with how I like to spend the time makes it easier to focus on why I got punished in the first place.  I know it\u2019s not just a \u201cstupid game\u201d to them.  They know it means something because I got a chance to explain why I like it.\n\n### 2. Learn What your Kid is Getting Out of It\n\nSo you have stretched yourself and listened to your swarthy son talk about his dungeon fortress.  I hope you find it wasn\u2019t as hard as you expected, but it\u2019s already time to level-up.  The next step is to find out what your child is getting out of video games.\n\nThis places even more importance on your understanding of how different video games can be.  Just as they are different, there is a number of strengths getting honed in each type of video game \u2013 and it\u2019s your job to find out what your child\u2019s game is honing exactly.\n\nSome games have a lot of history.  If you have ever walked in on your kid playing a game, and he is just kind of scrolling through screens and reading text, your kid is probably a bit of a history buff.  In these types of games, you generally play alone and travel around a strange world, gathering an overwhelming amount of conversational context from a number of different characters.  Your success in the game depends on your ability to distill a slew of conversations into meaningful direction and purpose.  That could almost make it on a resume.\n\nSome games require a lot of mastery and practice.  Games that move quickly and flash a lot of lights do so to try to distract the player from the main task, strengthening their ability to focus through and despite all the other \u201cnoise\u201d.  This is more important than you may think \u2013 just ask your [friendly neighborhood brain surgeon](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070220012341.htm).\n\nSome games are just plain stupid.  They are kind of repetitive, and sort of lose meaning once people get way too good at them.  But these are my favorite kind of games.  These games aren\u2019t designed to demand focus.  They are more to facilitate conversation.  They are ideal for hanging out.\n\nI have a lot of memories of playing Halo with friends.  We would chase each other around the same abandoned spaceship for hours, while the conversation meandered in and out of the petty tomeaningful.  It\u2019s amazing how one game can take you from just complaining about teachers to discussing the challenges of growing up in a mega church, or being a Christian guy in a public school.\n\nI have to really commend my parents now.  They had a very simple rule that I enjoyed my whole life.  Whenever I had friends over, we could play video games for as long as we wanted\u2026 even until sun-up if we had the stamina.  Thinking about all the meaningful moments of confession and confiding I had during those times, I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for that rule \u2013 and I would recommend you implement it in your home too.\n\nVideo games facilitate a lot of great behaviors (as listed above), but this is also your chance to see if they are affecting your child negatively.  God forbid you find out your kid loves games simply for the violence \u2013 or expressing his frustration.  God forbid your kid only likes video games because they are so much easier than physical activity, and everything else is boring.  God forbid you discover anything destructive that can lead to addictive habits, but rejoice in the fact that because you made it this far, you now have the influence and trust to fairly intervene.  Like I said \u2013 knowing that a parent has taken the time to understand my video game habit makes it much easier to focus on their concerns when they come up.\n\n\n### Leave your Nostalgia in the shoebox - it's a crappy standard\nLastly, I would like to address nostalgia.  I know it\u2019s scary thinking back on what video games meant to you and comparing them to the strange beast they are today.  You come from a time where video games didn\u2019t have the power to affect people\u2019s behavior.\n\nIf I were to advise you to condescend on your child and reserve your disappointment in how they don\u2019t spend their time building tree houses and playing board games like you did when you were young, I will warn you that there would be nothing I could do to stop Benjamin Franklin from laying a hand on your shoulder and being just as condescending to you for participating in something as new-fangled and futuristic as a manufactured board game.  After all, when he was a child there was nothing to do but sip brandy and read last month\u2019s almanac.\n\nShortly after, I could see Galileo coming up behind Benny, expressing his disappointment in Ben\u2019s fulfillment in something as weird and futuristic as an almanac.  After all, when he was young, he found just as much excitement in dissecting birds and carving his name on trees.\n\nStill after, Aesop approaches Galileo and furnishes his disgust with doing something as left-wing as dissecting birds.  After all, when he was a child, he was just as happy wrestling forty-year old men and throwing sheep knuckles at his friends.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/amoeba.gif\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>\u2026 then the ameoba condescends on the flagellate for requiring his silly, futuristic flagellum to locomote about\u2026</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\nI could go on, but my point is that nostalgia is a horrible standard.  The way your kids spend their time will always seem less valuable then the way you spent your time as a child, but you have to keep that to yourself.  That feeling is for you and you alone.  You have to let your kids have their time to.\n\nBecause in short time, we\u2019ll be just as disgusted with the way our kids spend their time.  While we all wish our kids played regular video games with hand-held controllers, our kids will be jumping on pads and flailing their arms around in virtual-reality bliss.  We feel the pain too.  We hate the idea of something as tacky as Wii Bowling becoming the new standard, but it is our burden to bear just as we are yours to bear.\n\n\n### In Closing\nI\u2019m not a parent, but I do love video games.  Coming out of that experience, I can sum it all up by saying you can never go wrong with just talking to your kid about the kinds of things he or she thinks is cool.  Even if what they are into is really different from the things you liked as a kid, you can\u2019t let that stop you from appreciating it.  Hell \u2013 even sit down and play a game.  Let your kid kick your butt in whatever game they are playing.  They\u2019ll be beaming the rest of the night \u2013 not because they won, mind you  - but because you showed you give a crap about the stuff they like.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/happyvideogamefamily.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>And if you win, then congratulations \u2013 you transcend generations with how awesome you are at things.

I wrote a commentary on a document Google made hours after it was released.  The document was ridiculous, but it got a little moody at the end.  I was especially paled when I heard Fibre was getting added to a flurry of [new locations](https://fiber.google.com/newcities/) (and is in no way stagnating).   Google is also doing what could be best described as *romancing* a plethora of [opensource robotics projects with Project Tango](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk).  For last week, sorry Google.\n\n<br>\n\n### I need the police\nBut this week, I need the police.\n\nWait-a-minute\u2026 not one on duty or anything.  That sounded a lot more urgent then I meant it.  What I meant is that I just need to run something by an authority figure so I can get a sense of how valid it is.\n\nI think I have come up with the perfect escape plan.  **Disclaimer: I don\u2019t condone running from the police**.  I also don\u2019t intend to use it myself, and I would certainly regret any of my readers using it to evade the law themselves.  You could say that I am simply doing my civic duty in helping the state lengthen the already long arm of the law.\n\n<br>\n\n### The Scenario\nYou got a bad rap.  Maybe you are walking on ice and eggshells after an iffy murder charge, or you received a harshly-worded letter regarding some illegally-obtained Shania Twain albums.  Maybe you still have a court date pending for that public drunkenness charge of yours at the Apple store (even though nobody yet knows that\u2019s just how you behave around new Apple products).\n\nThe point is you can\u2019t afford to get into trouble.  You have to keep your nose clean\u2026 which is why that it is problematic that you *just* got pulled over on a rural highway by a State policeman.\n\nThere is no talking your way out of this one.  Actually, it probably won\u2019t even be a ticket.  You have an order on your head to be deported and/or pistol whipped on site.\n\nFine \u2013 I don\u2019t watch a lot of CSI, so consequently, I can\u2019t escalate this hypothetical scenario to a point where you would admit you have *nothing* to lose.  You are just going to have to get there without me.  There is literally nothing to lose at this point.  You just need to *not* get arrested tonight.\n\n<br>\n\n### My Plan\n\n<br>\n\n#### Step 1: Floor the Car\nYou need to put some distance between you and the policeman.  You need to disappear into the horizon the best you can.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even tell me you won\u2019t be able to do that.  I learned from watching COPS that a trained policeman won\u2019t jump in his squad car right away.  Apparently, it\u2019s better to stand there and get a better sense of where the perp is heading (yes - you\u2019ve become a *perp* at this point, mind you).  I don\u2019t get it either, but it works to our advantage for now.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Step 2: Pull Over next to some trees or high corn\nThis is crucial.  You need to pull over next to some place that looks prime for escaping on foot.  Don\u2019t worry, if you follow my plan, you won\u2019t be doing a lot of running.  The key is to only make it *look* like you took off running.  Turn off the car and open the door.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/gtaheat.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>There is a good chance you are going to get up to 4 or 5 stars.

Get out of your car, climb into your trunk, and close it right up.\n\nAlthough my knowledge of police chase protocol comes up short here, I would imagine it would happen something like this\u2026\n\n* State patrol spots your car pulled over and squeals to a grinding halt\n* Policeman (and copious backup) jump out and inspect the scene with their guns drawn\n* Policemen see that your car is empty.  Using their instincts, they notice some bent foliage and conspicuous boot prints near the brushline (clever you)\n* Search commences in the woods.  They swarm the area with helicopters and maybe even landmines\n* They can\u2019t find you.  They also don\u2019t know what to do with your car\n* \u201cMeh.  Call a tow truck.  Let\u2019s just go home.  He was just a speeder anyway.\u201d\n* Cops go home.  Before the tow truck arrives, you release the trunk latch from the inside (which in my understanding, is a safety requirement in modern sedans)\n* Drive off, scrap the car (hand it over to Nicholas Cage to strip it, or whatever)\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/goneinsixtyseconds.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>\"I knew you would make it.

I never actually met any of the people that helped out before Marissa did.  Truth be told \u2013 I was just as surprised as she was walking out onto the patio.  Here is the full story:\n\nI started asking the internet for help with my big day about a month ago.  I had a basic idea of what I wanted.  I wanted to do it at the Shedd Aquarium, and I wanted a little quartet to play [Crazier by Taylor Swift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9B747RQM3w).  Subtlety was the goal here \u2013 which is why I chose to post to reddit.com under the alias \u2018BEAR_CIRCUMCISER\u2019.  You can read the [original thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1kvj6o/chicagoans_im_looking_to_hire_a_special_task/), but the gist of it was that I was looking for a string quartet and connections inside the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bearcircumciser.png\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>It\u2019s counter-intuitive, but bizarre, violent, capital-lettered usernames can invoke a lot of trust on certain sites.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe response was incredible.  Tons of people were coming forward all day.  I was passing out my email like a cheap party magician.  Not only did I get plenty of willing decorators, photographers, but also security detail, pilots, and even a piano on wheels.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get too far ahead of myself.  I wasn\u2019t going to let all this excitement make awry the original plan.  I wanted to keep it simple.\n\nThe first Redditor to commit was /u/ChicagoRex.  He was a down-to-earth university student who, in the fashion of a fast food fry cook, churned out a gorgeous quartet arrangement of Crazier only a few short days after my request.  Great work /u/ChicagoRex.  Nailed it.\n\nSecond to step up was /u/gobucks72, who was able to direct me to a fantastic quartet.  Clark Street Quartet was great to work with.  I sent them the sheet music once, and I didn\u2019t talk to them again until D-Day.\n\nThis was all good, but I still faced the daunting task of getting the esteemed Shedd Aquarium to allow us to prance around their facility close to and after closing hours.

This user was able to get Marissa and me into the Aquarium for free.  They even bought us tickets to see the aquatic show.\n\nThings were almost in place, but I was still in need of a photographer and a videographer.  /u/aweekendwarriorf and /u/mooseman90, who, respectively, produced a gorgeous video and a series of really beautiful pictures for the event.

Nobody gave them permission to join themselves to the very definition of what makes a man in our culture.

A coworker had simply asked me if I was going to watch the super bowl this weekend.  It was an innocent question, but I rarely pass up the opportunity to ride my *sports suck* high horse around the track.\n\nI wasn't always like this.  Let me take you back to the year 2002.  Between Tyler Arnason, Kyle Calder, Steve Sullivan, Mark Bell, and Jocelyn Thibault, the Chicago Blackhawks had the perfect recipe for a Stanley Cup that season. Despite their hyped lineup, they were absolutely terrible.  Chicagoans basically forgot this once bloodthirsty hockey team even existed - *that is* - all but *one* Chicagoan.\n\nEnter Alex.  He was twelve years, and once confessed to his counselor at AWANA that he idolizes hockey.  The self-donned slogan *I'M A HOCKEY PLAYER - END OF STORY* could be found on the title page of his diary.  He never missed a game, and no matter how last night ended up for the Hawks he always had enough pride in his city to write the score on the whiteboard the next day at school.  He would hand out little pocket sized season schedules that he laminated himself.  He watched every game on TV from start to finish.\n\nOne weekend, he even emptied the savings account his parents started for him when he was a baby to purchase three tickets to Maggiano's *Pucks and Pasta* - all just so he could eat plain spaghetti noodles in the same room as two professional Hockey players.\n\nThen something horrible happened.  Some terrible men announced on TV that there would be no hockey for the rest of the season.  A wages dispute caused the NHL coaches to go on strike.  Thus began the 2002 NHL lockout.  Alex was bitter - so bitter that he never turned to Sports Center again.  He forever resented anything and anyone that reminded him of the lonely desolation of the NHL lockout.\n\nWhich brought me here - an angry semi-regular yoga participant barking about how useless sports are in this country.  We finished up our lunch and I trudged back to my desk.  I checked my RSS feeds, like I usually do after lunch, and saw I had an unread XKCD comic sitting in my tray.\n\n![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/super_bowl.png)\n\nIt was like a knife through the heart.  I was overrun with the error of my ways.  Surely if the author of XKCD - probably the nerdiest person imaginable - could coexist with the sports world, then so could I.\n\nHe is absolutely right.  People cannot help what they are passionate about, and if it isn't hurting anyone, they shouldn't have to.  Pulling them aside to try to convince them that their passion makes them a lesser person is the furthest thing from polite.\n\nTake this as my formal apology, sports fans.  For all the times I have implied you had monkey brains, I am sorry.  I cannot promise it's going to be easy, but the next time a stranger approaches me at the bar and implores me for my take on Alabama's team this year, I'm going to do everything in my power to choke back the venom and kindly reply, \"I don't have much of an opinion - but I bet you do.  Let 'r rip, lonely bar stranger.\"  Enjoy the super bowl, everybody.  Tell me all about it tomorrow.\n", "description": "You are probably expecting a 'you suck if you are watching the superbowl' post.  You're wrong, reader.  I'm turning over a new leaf.

But it takes a real geek to know the third option.  That third, mysterious option is *Linux*.\n\nYou see, long ago there was this system that nerds and scientists used called *Unix*.  These were computers that favored performance over user friendliness.  They were great for crunching numbers, collecting data, and looking really cool on your desk.\n\nThe problem was they were expensive, and the software that came with it was not very configurable.  This all came to a head when a guy named Richard Stallman set out to write his own version of every tool unix had to offer - only his versions would be free and totally customizeable.\n\n![As it turns out, a man who set out to write his own version of Unix looks exactly like what you would expect him to](https://stallman.org/image001.jpg)\n\nStallman was able to write a liberated copy of just about every unix tool, all except for one important component - the *kernel*.  This is the routine of a computer that is responsible for allocating resources for all the other programs.  It is just as important as it sounds.\n\nIn great timing, a Finnish programmer by the name Linus Torlvalds humbly offered up his makeshift kernel sideproject.  He jokingly named it *Linux*, a combination of \"Linus\" and \"Unix\".  And so, there was born the mysterious third option feared by Best Buy employees.\n\n# The Best Kept Secret of Computing\n\nSo there is my incredibly informal history of Linux. I wasn't trying to be accurate beyond re-gleaning a few wikipedia articles.  If you are into computer history, write your own summary and I promise I will post it as an addendum.\n\nFor most of you click-and-close type of computer users out there, that prequel was a gigantic turn off.  Maybe I should have skipped it and just said this: there is a third option.  It's completely free, and if you don't like *anything* about it, there are hundreds of other options to choose from.  Sound a little more appetizing?\n\nLinux is really the best kept secret in computers.  For people who do know about it, they are usually only familiar with the really scary parts, leading them to say things like *Weren't the guys who leaked all those celbrity nudes using Linux?*  They probably were,  but they probably also used the same butter you do on their toast that morning.\n\nLinux gets a reputation for being built by and for the arrogant, basement-dwelling recluses.  But the reality is that you, dear reader, are probably smart enough to figure it out.\n\n# Why I use Linux\n\nI have been using Linux for about three years now.  The following are the prevailing reasons why I have stuck with it.\n\n### 1. Linux is Free\n\nLinux is totally free.  It's open source, which means the code is free for anyone to take and edit.  Not only can you [download](https://www.kernel.org/) it, but you can even *fork it*.  This means you can create your own version.\n\nIf you wanted, you could literally publish your own version of Linux under the name \"Maroon5 Sucks OS\", and I bet if you paid Google about a trillion dollars, they would base the next version of Chrome OS off of it and print \"Maroon5 Sucks\" right across the lid.  But Google probably wouldn't do this for anything short of a trillion dollars.  As it turns out, you are not as dependable of a maintainer as the people who work on the official Linux kernel.\n\nSo why do those maintainers do it, especially when they don't always get paid?  In programming, \"money' isn't the only form of *money*.  There is also time.\n\nLet's say you have three teams of people that make competing software.  The bosses pay their engineers to build applications profitable applications.  The development of these applications will take time.\n\nLet's say that all three of these teams have to overcome a really *obnoxious* problem - like accounting for timezones.  This is code that they will all have to write, test, and maintain.  It also needs to be perfectly accurate.\n\nSo why would all three teams write their own?  Why not just share one algorithm that they all test, contribute to, and maintain together?  That way they save time and get to focus on the stuff that is more important to their bosses.  Nobody gets paid for the code, but it makes everyone's life a whole lot easier.  They are paid in *time*.\n\nThis is how open source generally works.  A bunch of people pitch in and write something that makes everybody's life a lot easier.  The maintainers of the official Linux kernel keep at it because they need it - and so do many other people.\n\nThis wonderful concept can trickle down to end users, even if they will never write a line of code in their life.  When you use Linux, you can ride on the coat tails open source symbiosis - and the best part of it all is that these programmers are delighted to have you along for the ride.  More users mean better testing.  With your permission, they can collect information from your machine and work on the errors that you find.  You, in exchange for free software, become an extreme test case explorer.\n\n![To reproduce this bug, eat an entire bag of pull-n-peel twizzlers and watch cat videos for several hours straight.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/catvideo.jpg)\n\n### 2. Linux is Customizeable\n\nHave you ever downloaded an update and felt instantly depressed once you saw the new changes to your favorite app or system?  The biggest example of this kind of upset that should be staring you in the face is Windows 8.  For whatever reason, Microsoft looked at the world's most popular operating system and though, \"Let's make the next version totally unrecognizeable.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong - some people like the giant tiles and bright primary colors.  That's not the point.  My point is that if you want to continue to use Windows, *you have no choice* but to live with Microsoft's sometimes erratic design decisions.\n\nIn the land of Linux, the tables turn.  When a distribution (i.e., a flavor of Linux) release an update, it is done with great fear and trembling.  Why is that?  It's because distribution maintainers know that any poor design decisions on their part can cause an equal and opposite exodus of faithful users.\n\nConsequently, there are thousands of versions to choose from, and fearing your dissatisfaction, most of them include plenty of ways to customize your user experience.\n\nThere are versions that look really similiar to Windows.\n\n![](http://www.linuxmint.com/pictures/screenshots/lisa/mate.png)\n\nThere are versions that look *exactly* like Windows.\n\n![](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqUOHZF6FfI/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nThere are versions that look like something out of the control room of Jurassic Park.\n\n![](http://windowmaker.org/screenshots/NeXT-Retro.png)\n\nThere are versions that look exactly like your mom's Mac.\n\n![](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Pear-OS-8-Has-Been-Officially-Released-398742-2.png)\n\nThere are versions that are look like a combination of Mac and Windows.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kykZrBb.png)\n\nAnd there are versions that look like a whole different animal all together.\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Ubuntu_12.04.png)\n\nThe point is you never have to be a sucker for someone else's opinion.  If you believe that the last good looking computer was made in 1991, you can use that look forever.  If you like to use something different every day, you can make changes on the fly.  You can switch the clock to army time, change the color of the window's shadows, and even use a little picture of your dog as the mouse cursor.  The choices in Linux are unlimited.\n\n### 3. Linux is Organized\n\nEveryone has their own software preferences.  Remind yourself of your own, then imagine yourself setting up a fresh new Windows or Mac computer.\n\n1. Open Safari or Internet Explorer (*make sure you wash your hands after*).  Go to Firefox's website.  Download installer, open, and follow the instructions.\n\n2. Go to VLC's website.  Download installer, open, and follow the instructions.\n\n3. Go to GIMP's website.  Download installer, open, and follow the instructions.\n\n4. Go to Thunderbird's website.  Download installer, open, and follow the instructions.\n\nThe pattern is inevitably tedious.  Even worse, the only way you are going to know these applications need to be updated is faith that they will individually nag you the next time you open them.  The whole system is ecclectic at best and a mess at worst.\n\nIn Linux, a beautiful thing called *package management* is used.  If you don't know what it is now, it's about to become your new favorite thing.  All the software available for the system comes from one source.  Therefore, if you want to install anything new, you only need to visit one place.  Most versions of Linux make it look really pretty and browsable, but the reality is that installing anything takes only one *command*.\n\nIn Ubuntu (a popular version of Linux), performing the above steps would look like this:\n\n    sudo apt-get install firefox vlc gimp thunderbird\n\nThe above command tells the system to go out and fetch the *packages* for firefox, VLC, GIMP, and Thunderbird.  Better yet, these items are added to the list of programs that are checked for updates.  About once a week, your system will tell you there are new updates to download - this includes *everything* that you have installed.\n\nSome packages are more unofficial and take a few more commands.  To install Spotify on a new system, I would have to do this:\n\n    sudo apt-add-repository -y \"deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free\"\n    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59\n    sudo apt-get update -qq\n    sudo apt-get install spotify-client\n\nThis is basically augmenting what the system defines as the central repository to include spotify.com.  But most \"app stores\" for Linux will just do this for you in the background (with your permission of course).\n\nWant a real sales pitch?  Imagine what you would have to go through to uninstall all of the above applications in Windows.  There is an uninstallation process that is unique to each of them, and some of them even leave artifacts on your machine.\n\nTo *completely* remove all of the above applications from an Ubuntu computer, this will do it:\n\n    sudo apt-get remove --purge spotify-client gimp firefox vlc thunderbird\n\nAbracadabra.  The applications are totally removed and they are no longer rolled into your software updates.\n\nPackage management is one of those things that you can never stop using once you figure out how to use it.  If you have an obsessive need to keep things clean and organized in your workspace, switching to Linux would be worth it for the package management alone.  I even keep a giant list of all my favorite software on hand.  That way, if I ever want to do some spring cleaning of my system and start from scratch, I just run a script - and by the time I've made a sandwhich and come back, I have all of my favorite software installed on my machine.\n\n### 4. Linux is Fun\n\nThis reason is much more subjective than the others.  Getting to customize anything I want on my computer makes using my computer more fun.  I'll be honest, sometimes I go a little crazy and break something.  I'll install a theme or plugin that wasn't quite ready for the general public, and now I can't boot into my desktop.  But you just have to make reasonable preparations if you are going to go off of the beaten path and do some *ricing* (customization).  Keep backups, read things *before* you do them, don't start anything big too late at night, and never drink around blank DVD's.  I've personally coined the term *drunk partition*.  This is when you wake up next to a bottle of Honey Jack with a new hard drive partition that you don't recognize and a DVD with a handwritten label that says \"FREEBSD lol ;)\".\n\nDon't get me wrong - there are plenty of means in the Linux community to set up something simple and dependable and mind your own business.  But for whatever reason, most of us take weird pleasure in breaking our machine and learning about our system by fixing it.\n\n# Good Reasons Why *Not* to Use Linux\n\nOne of the biggest things that scared me about switching to Linux was the difference in software.  To be honest, switching would not be helpful if your life depends on really expensive and/or exclusive software.\n\nIf you are a graphic designer and you pretty much spend all day in Adobe Photoshop, keep using whatever you are using.  There is no easy way to use Photoshop in Linux.\n\nHowever, if you just need something to resize pictures, turn a few of your camera phone shots into artsy black and white expressions, or shop a Hitler moustache onto your baby, [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) totally gets the job done.\n\nIf you live your whole life out of iTunes and liken your Apple ID to your social security number, stay on a Mac.  It wouldn't really make sense for you to switch.\n\nHowever, if you just need something to roll through your big fat folder of mp3s or play your home videos, there are tons of options for media players in Linux.\n\nIf you know the Microsoft Office suite better than you know your family and you are an absolute virtuoso in Microsoft excel, stick with Windows.  However, if you just need something to crank out essays and make decent lab reports, [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) is a great replacement.\n\nThere is always the Google option to.  Linux run Google Chrome like a champ, so if you spend most of your time in Drive, Google Play, YouTube, Gmail, and Hangouts, you will feel right at home.\n\nOne category of people that used to fall into this section was PC gamers.  But the tides are turning, reader.  Last year, the popular Gaming client *Steam* became available for Linux, and in only one year more than 800 games have been produced for Linux.  It still pales in comparison to what's out for Windows, but Gabe Newell has clearly outlined his intention to move the future of PC gaming to Linux.\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rCGMiT0CQAI\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<br/>\n\nLastly, you shouldn't use Linux if you don't know how to search the Internet for answers.  Many Linux users would probably scream at me for saying this, but there is no official help for Linux (that is, a single *Linux* company you can call).  Some people just need the comfort of knowing they can call Microsoft and, after an hour of sitting on hold, talk to someone who is paid by the people who make their computer.\n\nThere's no *official* place to get help, but there are literally thousands of places online where people want to help you for fun.\n\nOnce of my favorite places to get help has been the [Linux4Noobs](http://reddit.com/r/linux4noobs) subreddit, which offers their help in anything - from general questions to utter disaster recovery.\n\nThere is also the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), which serves as a freely edited instruction manual.  Though it is written for the Arch Linux distribution, many Linux users consult it when they need something technically detailed.\n\nBut above all, *Google is your friend*.  Most errors in Linux can be resolved by just pasting the error message into Google and reading the first result.  In my opinion, that beats the socks off of any official customer support helpline.\n\n![I don't know anyone who has ever been helped by clicking the 'check online' button.](http://cdn.windows7themes.net/pics/internet-explorer-has-stopped-working.jpg)\n\n# How to Try Linux\n\nDon't worry.  In this section, we're not going to do anything serious.  I'm going to tell you how to try out Linux, but also assume that you have massive issues with commitment.  No one is commiting to anything here.\n\nBefore I lay out my recommended ways of trying out Linux, I'd first like to nip a particularly bad way in the butt.  If you've looked into this before, you have probably come across *dual booting*.\n\nDual booting is when you install two operating systems on one computer.  When you power of your computer, you select which system you want to start.\n\nDual booting is a bad idea - *especially* if you are a beginner.  I know it seems like a reasonable transition into Linux, but you will just be making it harder to use Linux *and* whatever was already on your computer.  I've tried just about everything, and have returned to tell you that dual booting is not as fun as people make it sound.  Additionally, it just makes people's first impressions of Linux worse than they could be.\n\nNow that we have had a family chat about the dangers of *dual booting*, here is how you can try Linux (and keep your serious issues with commitment in tact).\n\n### 1. Use a Live CD\n\nComputers can \"boot off of\" things other than themselves.  I like to think of it like putting your car up on a jack.  You can temporarily have your computer live off of a CD, SD card, or USB while it sets your hard drive aside.\n\nThis is a great way to try Linux.  You can create a CD, which will almost always give you the option of just *trying it out* before you install.\n\nThe hardest part about doing this is that you have to *burn* the CD yourself.  Here's how it will go:\n\n1. Download a Linux image.  This will be a file that ends in *.iso*.  Most of them are pretty big, so it may take a while.  Here is a link to [Ubuntu's](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) download page.\n\n2. Grab a blank CD or DVD.  You are going to want to burn the iso to the disc.  Both Mac and Windows usually have built in utilites to do this, but if you are not sure how, now would be a good time to prime your *Google-Fu*.  Make sure you burn it as slowly as possible.\n\n3. Insert the disc into your drive.  Wait until it registers, then power down your computer.  Once it is completely off, power it back on.  If you have Windows, follow the instructions in your boot screen (it's usually one of the f keys) until you find a place where you can select the disc.  If you are on a Mac, hold down the alt key and wait until the disc become available to select.  Bear in mind, it's been a while since I have done this.  The boot process may be different for each computer, but it's easy to find (even if this has to be your *last* call to geeksquad ever).\n\n4. You should see the purple splash screen.  Ubuntu will present you with two options - Install, or try it out.  I think it's clear which you should pick.\n\n5. Once you are done playing around in Ubuntu, power down, then power back on without doing anything.  You should be back in your own system, where you can remove the disc and pretend none of this ever happened (unless you enjoyed it).\n\n### 2. Virtualization\n\nVirtualization is a need little trick.  Without ever turning off your computer, you can launch a tiny *virtual* computer in a window.  Given, it won't be as powerful, but it's a great way to try something out in a truly isolated sandbox.\n\nI like to use [VirtualBox](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virtualbox.org%2F&ei=Sn1zVLakENikyATktICgCQ&usg=AFQjCNHpshI_45ZdaFl7Mvf-glSeroKujQ&sig2=B5iRMZDHgKsjFoqU3jl70Q&bvm=bv.80185997,d.aWw).  It's free, and pretty dependable.  Download the software and the ISO mentioned above and create a new virtual machine.  While setting up, you will load the ISO file into the *virtual* dvd drive of your virtual machine.  Once you are set up, you can play and pause it like a VCR.  All of the happenings of this dangerous Linux experiment will be contained to a little window on your computer.  Once you are done, you can power it down and delete it.\n\n### 3. An Old Computer\n\nGet an old computer.  Linux can run on pretty much anything, especially a $50 craigslist laptop or your dad's old PC.\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nI hope now, reader, that you can rid yourself of the notion that Linux is for super elite hackers.  Truthyfully, Linux is for just about anyone that knows how to operate a computer, doesn't mind learning something new, and likes to pick their own colors.  There are literally [hundreds of thousands](http://distrowatch.com/) of *distros* to try.  If you have some freetime, pick up a pack of blank DVDs and take the first 25 that look interesting to you.

I don\u2019t know when it happened, but somewhere in time Disney decided to supplement their historic tenderness with the scientific rigor of a particle accelerator.  I\u2019m no visual arts guy, but I could imagine the difficult undertaking of a movie set in a frozen tundra.  The primary color is *white*.  The running theme will be ice.  How do you even draw an icecube?  I can barely churn out one of those clever transparent cubes that everyone used to doodle in their textbooks in gradeschool, stopping well short of a glistening ice castle.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/transparentcube.png\" height=\"100\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Something tells me the entry exam for Disney\u2019s creative team will be a little more intense than this little number.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe bill was footed with a novel simulation algorithm straight from Disney\u2019s labs known as *material point method*.  I\u2019m assuming this involves more than just a white crayon and some baking soda.\n\n<br>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9H1gRQ6S7gg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\nBut all zippy graphics and photoshop finesse aside, how was the plot?  If we learned anything from *Beowulf*, the Star Wars prequels, and anything that has ever left the pen of Michael Bay, a good movie needs more than just good effects.  You can be sure that Frozen will fill your fuzzy-feeling tank from beginning to end.  At this point, there may not be such thing as a Disney movie that lacks a nostalgic vibe.  With the digital freedom of a CGI film you wield the laser-guided harmony of music, voice acting, and visuals.  It has ups, downs, laughs, and aww\u2019s in all the right places.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/buildasnowman.png\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Seriously?  Just make a snowman with her already.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n### We can go deeper\n\nLet\u2019s go a little deeper.  I\u2019m going to warn you, we are going to start spoiling some eggs.  I meant it \u2013 if you haven\u2019t seen the movie, bookmark this and come back to it later.\n\nI first took interest in Olaf the snowman.  On first accounts, he fits snuggly into the Disney type of the comedy-driven ragdoll companion.  This kind of character usually comes through in some key moment using sheer dumb luck to bail the hero out of a suspenseful bind, all while copping a few laughs with either an inflated ego or a speech impediment.\n\nBut has anyone else noticed how Disney sidekicks are getting younger?  Let me explain.  Take the movie Balto.  If you don\u2019t remember, Balto also had a wacky sidekick.  His name was Boris, and he was a goose with an inflated sense of wisdom.\n\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0qFW-9jjfrE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\nAt a quick glance, Boris pretty much fulfills a similar role.  He gets a few laughs and helps his hero out.  But take a closer examination at Boris.  His jokes are exaggerated.  They are predictable.  Even though he is not really that funny judging by punchlines alone, you laugh at him the same way you would laugh at your grandpa.  He\u2019s just kind of a goofy character who redeems his stale sense of humor with delivery and charm.\n\nOlaf, on the other hand, is quirky, random, and a little out of his element.  That\u2019s because he is pretty much a meme.  He is your commonplace Internet forum urchin slapped in the middle of the forest.  He is very articulate, but clumsy and not very physical.\n\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uoQSIziGnIM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a skull\u2026 or bones.\u201d  This is not actually a joke.  You only laugh because of the timing.  This is Internet humor.  The punchline, instead of climax, is an unspoken *well that was awkward*.  This just goes to show you that Disney has been watching the pulse of what makes people laugh.\n\n<br>\n\n### Remove this woman from my fridge.\nAnother departure from the traditional feel-gooder was the role of the women.\n\nLet me first introduce the idea of the *woman in the fridge*.  This is a metaphor that arose out of the comic book era.  Initially, it was a chatroom joke in reference to a 1994 issue of The Green Latern in which the hero, Kyle Rayner, returns to his aparment to find his girlfriend murdered and literally stuffed into his refrigerator.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/comicmasogeny.jpg\" height=\"200\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Great scott, woman!  Why aren't you cooking?</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe idea is that comics, in one way or another, were always just stuffing women into fridges.  The only time you ever saw a woman in comic books was when we needed some quick access to suspense.  It was almost like writers would just \u201cgrab a woman out of the fridge\u201d when they needed to make things intense, much like you would grab ketchup out of your fridge to make your fries taste better.\n\nAn ideal fridge woman was the iconic Louis Lane.  You only saw Louis Lane when Kent needed to look buff.  Why do we care about this villian?  It\u2019s because Louis Lane is dangling over a shark tank.\n\nThe irony in this movie is so thick, you could chip it with an icepick.  Frozen was the first Disney movie I have seen in a while to take the woman out of the fridge.\n\nAll signs up to the end of the movie seemed typical enough.  The plot tension congealed on a moment when Elsa, the ice queen was grieving the accidental maming of her sister Anna.  Hans, the nefarious prince trying to con his way into royal power raises his sword to slay Elsa in her grief as Anna, inches from death by \u201cfrozen heart\u201d remedied only by a true act of love awaits a kiss of salvation from the heroic Kristoff.\n\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d I thought.  Kristoff is going to do some kind of sweet slide tackle and murder-kick the crap out of Hans.  Anna will freeze over, but Kristoff will make out with her anyway.  A little red glow will well up inside Anna\u2019s chest, and she will promptly thaw into Kristoff\u2019s arms.\u201d\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong!  To my delight, Anna abandoned Kristoff\u2019s efforts and, in a last pang of strength, steps in front of Hans\u2019 death blow just before icing over into a statue.  Hans it knocked back by the mystical ice powers.  Before this, Disney had my curiosity.  Now, dear reader, they had my attention.\n\nTo my amazement, Anna began to thaw, and Kristoff wasn\u2019t even in the picture.  That\u2019s when it finally dawned on me.  The act of love needed to thaw Anna was her own act of saving her sister.  Talk about removing a woman from the fridge \u2013 Kristoff wasn\u2019t even necessary in the most important part of the film.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get full blown feminist here, but this is an important precedent.  I commend Disney for their artistic participation in the movement to empower women.  I won\u2019t pretend to know much about what pre teen girls go through, but I can\u2019t imagine the message of *wait until your prince makes your life meaningful* helps at all.  But an example of sisterly love saving the day?  That\u2019s priceless.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that you are a strong, powerful woman who don\u2019t need no man.\n\nSo that\u2019s my take on Frozen. Disney spends an extra buck or two on a new, fancy snow-simulating algorithm to empower young women and, hopefully, remove them from the fridge once and for all.  I\u2019d say that was a buck well spent, Disney.\n\n<br>\n\n### Rewriting this thing\nNow as tradition, I\u2019d like to offer my own artistic re rendering of the ending.  I\u2019m going to warn you \u2013 it\u2019s very violent.  It is not recommended if you are a child, pregnant, taking heart-medication, or somehow all three.  I\u2019m not proposing this would fix the movie in the same way I wrote an ending for The Vow (read [here](/the-vow)).  This is purely fan fiction at this point merely meant to enhance your experience.\n\nLet me cue up my scene.  Elsa is knelt at the feet of Hans, who is seconds from lopping off her head.  Anna is nearly frozen, and it is clear that Kristoff is not going to reach her in time to do anything.  Aaaaaaaaaaaand ACTION.\n\n<br><hr>\nHans' blade falls swiftly upon Elsa.  Anna falls to her knees, ice below her      pooling with her fallen sister's thin, cold blood.  She is now truly as cold as   ice, and with nothing to fight for, she surrenders a final whisp of breath before succumbing to a frozen coffin.  Kristoff continues running, and bewildered by     rage, knocks Hans to the ground.  There is a scuffle, but it is clear that Hans   has more upper body strength.  He flips the boyish Kristoff on his back and claws for his sword.\n\n\"I've wahn.  Nahw, I will breeeeak you,\" Hans growls deeply in an uncharacteristic  Russian accent.  He sinks the blade deep into Kristoff's heart, but just before Hans can languish in his victory, he begins to feel the ground shake.  He peers up to Anna.\n\nHer once stone cold figure is now smoldering.  A deep crimson begins to glow,     fester, and melt away the ice.  Small flames begin to lick from her finger tips,  as devilish eyes pry wide with the wild hunger.\n\n\"You may have somehow broken the curse,\" squeeled Hans. \"But you will never take  back your kingdom with all the love in your heart.\"  Anna spoke calmly with a     still voice.\n\n\"Oh, not love Mr. Hans.  Not love at all.\"  Hans furrowed his brow and peered at  Anna.  He was trepidating now.\n\n\"RAGE.\"  Anna exploded with the fury of a star.  Hans was caught up in a brilliant flame and vaporized instantly.  Anna closed her eyes and released the most       hellish heat that anyone had ever witnessed.  As her symphony of fiery chaos      subsided, she slumped back to the ground.  Ash fell around her feet as the sound  of helicopter blades began to roar over her shoulder.\n\n\"Ve hahve you suuurownded.  Der ihs noooo escahpe,\" hollared an army man over a   megaphone.  Anna flung herself around and let forth another flame, sending the    helicopter crashing into the ground.  But before Anna could let fly another, she  felt the arid sting of a sniper rifle bullet rip through the flesh of her         shoulder.  Anna tumbled to the ground.\n\nAnna awoke in a cold metal room.  It was her prison cell.  There, she would remain for several years in darkness, priscinding.\n\nUntil one day, her door was opened.  Several guards in flame-retardant hazmat     suits escorted Anna to a quiet room that she had never scene before.  There she   saw a small, bald man seated politely in a wheel chair.\n\n\"I didn't expect to get any visitors.  Everyone I know is dead.\"  said Anna,      trying to conceal her curiosity.\n\n\"I know about you, Anna.\" said the stranger.  \"You have an amazing... gift.\"\n\n\"A gift?  HA.\" retorted Anna sharply.  \"Tell that to everyone I killed in the     blast in my home town.  I'm a monster.  I'm a murderer!  I'm a...\"\n\n\"A mutant?\" finished the old man.  Anna was in tears now.  The stranger wheeled   closer to Anna and placed his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"Anna, my name is Professor Xavier.  I have a school for gifted people like you.  It is a sanctuary for mutants like you and me.  There, I wish to groom your       abilities into something special.  Come with me.\"\n\nMusic heightens as the camera spins out.

I had to stare at some of these \u2018pictures\u2019 for several minutes before I could start typing.  I\u2019m going to confess, I\u2019m still not totally sure what the hell I\u2019m talking about.\n\nAs a teen, I spent a lot of time feeling guilty about my life.  I\u2019ll go ahead and needlessly point out that this feeling was ridiculous, since I really didn\u2019t do a whole lot.  Even though I did nothing but study, eat, listen in class, and play video games for about an hour a night, I carried around the same kind of guilt an ex con would.\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t tell, pride was a big deal for me.  Ironically, this introspection passed breezily by all my arrogant pseudo-genius ramblings and took serious issue with talking *too much*.  One wise crack in class - even if the teacher really did appreciate it - triggered weeks of contrition and regret for my \u2018foolishness\u2019.\n\nAlso, I guess I read the Koran.  Don\u2019t worry, I always kept a Bible nearby, almost as if I were playing with propane and it were a fire exstinguisher.  Don\u2019t get me wrong - in between all the silly inflated observations I made, I am grateful for those few and rare times I actually learned something on my own.  If my study of the Koran was legitemate, I remember that Islam insists that the worst sin imaginable is stealing (for the reasons I listed).  That\u2019s one way to look at it, I guess.\n\nOr not.  I guess I just went on to prove it wrong somehow...\n\nI also went on to prove CS Lewis right.  Take that, Islam.  I\u2019m going to assume that one of you has already took it upon yourselves to call *Christianity Today* and tell them the good news.  Now I can\u2019t really say any of these thoughts were original.  Like most of my musings, it was just a recycled lecture from my philosophy class minced with bizarre wordplay.\n\nI\u2019d also like to point out my tendency to draw diagrams when diagrams were not needed.  I lived pretty much my whole life believing myself to be a *visual* person.  This is why my failure in Art class and affinity for grammar class always perplexed me.  But I was convinced I had great ideas for diagrams.  These \u2018diagrams\u2019 were just sentences with a few lines connecting words.  It turns out I don\u2019t have a visual bone in my body.\n\n![A gracious visual aid to help you through the \u2018love my neighbor/hate my neighbor\u2019 dilemma](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/prideDiagram.jpg)\n\n*The greatest sin is pride*.

On a more serious level, I\u2019m a bit of an introvert, so there are not a lot of options for physical activity.  Off the top of the dome, I can think of skateboarding, bowling, carnival games, and running from the government.\n\n![Jason Bourne is the perfect example of how you can be physically active without any meaningful interpersonal interaction - if you do not count throwing passports and pieces of glass at people](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/mattdamon.jpg)\n\nI\u2019ve spent my first few months crawling parking lots and baseball dugouts, dipping out when someone with a dog walks by for shame that a sociological other will externalize my private hobby before I am ready too.

I was ready to graduate to the skate park.\n\n![It is clean now, but in time it will be covered in my blood.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bowl.jpg)\n\nThis is the Olympic skate park in Schaumburg.  The park is not lit, so I usually go during the narrow time frame between kids going home for dinner and the nearby softball field finally shutting their lights off for the night.  Sometimes I would have to stall  if there were people that hung around.  I just played Minion Rush on my phone until I got the place to myself.\n\nTonight, I was running out of time.  There were two stragglers, and from a distance I could tell they were pretty good.  I made a decision.  At least they were hucking on the side of the park opposite to my ledge.  See, the park is pretty big, but I usually just hang out by a little stumpy ledge.  There, I practice the same line.  I jump on the board, kick three times, then try to ollie up on the ledge.  Most times I lose my board and slam my head on the pavement.  Sometimes, I make it up, but panic as the ledge shortly drops off again.  This is when I proceed to lose my board and slam on the pavement \u2013 again.  Sometimes, when I am really on fire, I can wipe out before even reaching the ledge.\n\nFor twenty minutes, we stayed out of each other\u2019s way.  But on one attempt, he board flung out from my feet.  I squealed as the deck sailed into another skater.  He scooped up my board and walked slowly over to me.\n\nIf I had a can of mace, I would have uncapped it.  If I had brass knuckles, I would probably be too embarrassed to do anything with them.  The fella handed me my board and asked, \u201cSo are you new at skating.\u201d\n\nYes.  I am so new at skating.  This helmet also doesn\u2019t fit me, and I ordered everything you see here on Amazon.\n\n\u201cLet me show you what you are doing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe dude jumped on his board and demonstrated a crystalline ollie.  After a few more pointers, we got to talking.  Learning they were only sixteen made me embarrassed at how self-conscious I was around them.  The guys, Trevell and Tony, told me not to worry \u2013 that no one who skates at the Olympic is a huge tool to newbies.  They were nice kids, and, thanks to my pleasant experience, I am going to keep at it.  I promise to post a GIF of me jumping onto that eight inch ledge once I nail it.\n\nThanks, you guys.

I\u2019m a little embarrassed, but if you are a blogger I am sure you understand that you can catch yourself actually *surfing* your own site.

I know the *status quo* for graduating seniors is that most of their jokes ought end with \u201c\u2026 and I can\u2019t believe they are giving me a degree in this stuff\u2026\u201d, but secretly I think they are some of the most hell-certain people on earth.\n\nA college senior may joke about their own sense of inadequacy, but don\u2019t you buy it for a second.\n\nBut maybe you really are as useless graduating as you think you are.  I have no idea.  I have never met you.  I\u2019m just telling you what was happening in my head.\n\n<br>\n\n### Making a quaint home in that feeling of uselessness\nBut the scariest lesson that I learned after college was that I really am useless.  And living a life buttressed by an unbroken line of grand delusions leaves you with\u2026 a really big delusion.  Deep down inside, I really expected to spend most of my time teaching people things.  I may have given people the impression that I was interested in experience as derived from the experience of others, but I think I actually expected to be OK.\n\nI know, right?  Disgusting.  If you are graduating college and this is kind of hitting you like grapefruit in the eye, let\u2019s add a little understanding to this.  In hindsight, I feel like it\u2019s kind of inevitable that college Seniors are so self-centered right out of the gate.\n\nAfter all, everything has been about you.  Everything around you has existed to teach you something.  I\u2019m reminded of Neo\u2019s test in the Matrix.\n\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/oXv3SSijPFc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\nI think all those nights I was stressing out \u2013 feeling like my future was falling apart \u2013 was just part of a grand simulation.  I\u2019m not sure if I was ever actually in any danger, because if you tried your best in overcoming a challenge that a teacher gave you and failed, everyone failed.  You didn\u2019t learn anything, and even though your teacher will put on a tough face and give you the grade you deserve, she will likely go home and reevaluate the challenge.  Homework assignments really just simulate real world problems, save when you fail, everything melts out of view to make room for the next working world simulation.\n\nIn other words, you can actually change the outcome of problems by failing.  They go away, and an easier problem is presented.\n\n<br>\n### Your education isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s chief purpose \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t be\nThis is why coming into an actual workplace was so jarring.  Your failure doesn\u2019t change the outcome.  If you are given a task at work and you fail, nothing about the problem changes.  The task doesn\u2019t exist to teach you anything.  Sure \u2013 your employer will be delighted if you do, but no one will flinch if you don\u2019t.  Money is still made, business is still done, and the corporation marches on.  Everyone who collaborated with you at 4:30 PM is already more focused on their kids by 5:30 PM.\n\nIt\u2019s because working for a company, your education shouldn\u2019t govern your actions \u2013 it should follow them.\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t sounding like just another \u201cwork sucks\u201d blog.  I rejoice in this.  People may not depend on your education in your field, but they do depend on your output.  Naturally, your self-driven education should lead to more output, but the distinction is important if you ever want to escape the self-centered perspective on problems ingrained in us during our education.\n\nAt work, there are a lot of meetings.  Don\u2019t talk at first.  Seriously \u2013 if you will just be logical for a second, what could you possibly contribute to a discussion about the vision for the company or the best way to make stake-holders happy?  I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t participate \u2013 listen like hell and fill every moment of dead air with a good question.\n\nEventually, there will be a need for your input, and it will feel very right and appropriate.  I\u2019m sure this is true for any line of work, but I have noticed in my line of work that the longer you hang around, the more pieces of the architecture you touch; and the more pieces you touch, the more insights you can contribute.  At some time, someone is going to want to know what font the *Export Worklist* button at the bottom corner of the page is using.

I like to think I am always collection information.  I help out when I can, but I am doing my best to always default on *listening* instead of *relating*.\n\nGod bless teachers, but God, also bless the weary, vetted souls that have to work with college graduates.  We need a lot of help.  We might try to show off every now and then with the little we know, but it\u2019s just because we feel the need to surround ourselves with something familiar \u2013 if not our friends and classmates, it\u2019s something that feels like the success we were feeling under the support of teachers.  And don\u2019t be afraid to yell at us \u2013 I mean, really loudly.  I swear that four minutes into a rant from that one scary dude at work who\u2019s been there forever was just as dense as a four year degree, in most respects.\n\nI am becoming a daily-grinder, a cubicle warrior, and a regular Dilbert reader.  I get coffee headaches, I live for the weekend, and I prepare my small talk ahead of time.  I pack a lunch, accumulate memorabilia with software company logos, and smile at our receptionist every morning.  I think I am really starting to like the working world.  Most importantly, I am getting very comfortable with the idea of being part of something that isn\u2019t ultimately architected to teach me anything.\n\nSee you at the water cooler, readers.

But between the harrowing, shadowy dystopian cinema and hellfire, red-faced radio hosts, I can\u2019t seem to find an opinion that *is not* larger than life itself.  Call me selfish, but if someone were to ask me to imagine my life in a global civilization subdued by one powerful, all-knowing global government, my first thought wouldn\u2019t be *What would happen to the Mona Lisa?* or *Here is what I think will become of the euro...*\n\nI find it much more compelling to talk about the small annoyances in light of the trivial advantages of a totalitarian government. I\u2019m not interested in the things about this new life of no privacy and complete provision that would make you dump ash on your head, nor make you bark *Power to the People, Man*.  We have all seen the *Steven Spielberg* version of the dystopian totalitarian government, but have any of us sat through the *John Candy* version?\n\nFollowing that brief context, here are *Things that would suck, and things that would be preeeeeeety good about a global totalitarian government*:\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\n# Good: No more emails from viagra\n\nImagine this, reader.  You wake from bed and begin your first morning as a compulsory patriotic citizen of earth.  You open the government sanctioned email application on your computer and notice that there is no spam folder in your email.  \u201cAh - I see the catch.  I\u2019m not allowed to filter for spam in this stupid global government.  I just have to keep it in my email,\u201d you mumble through your morning breath.\n\n*But you are wrong*.  There is no spam in this new world order.  There are no more emails from Viagra because the government has already selected their favorite male enhancement pill and liquidated the other companies (and they probably just started adding it to everyone\u2019s drinking water anyway).  No more email spam, comrade.\n\nBut think bigger!  Think about every commercial on TV that makes you mad - those Sonic commercials where the camera makes people\u2019s head look too big for their neck... the GoDaddy ads that brag about how many of their commercials got banned from the Super Bowl... those fake parties where a bunch of beautiful people celebrate when someone shows up with a bag of Wendy\u2019s... they are all gone.  Not only that, but all of the people that were paid to write those stupid commercials were probably shot into space as punishment for their stupid, stupid ideas for commercials.\n\nSee?  You have only been awake in your new miserable existence for maybe fifteen minutes, and you can\u2019t help but crack a smile.\n\n<br>\n\n# Good: Reality TV is actually real\n\nI can\u2019t watch shows like American Idol, Survivor, or The Apprentice.  I am too irked by the suspicion that none of these people are actually embarrassed, weary, nor actually getting fired from something.\n\nSome things on TV I know are staged.  If you are like me, you would need both hands to count the times you have thrown an empty bottle of Jim Beam at the TV because some scummy parents staged a *hilarious* mishap with their eight-year-old and were honored on America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos.  Am I really the only one that takes this title seriously?  I\u2019m flabbergasted that someone cheating in a sporting event as obscure as a cycling can darken American optimism, while a sacred ritual that is supposed to honor the *Funniest Home Videos in America* is desecrated every day.\n\nBut imagine a world where there are cameras everywhere.  They roll 24/7 without commercial breaks.  And since there is no short of human shame, I believe reality TV would inherit a sweet return to its authentic, human shame roots.\n\nIn a world of indiscriminate government surveillance, every house can become the *Real World*.  And no more stringing us honest *Real World* viewers along with phony character developments and big-network-prodded-plot-twists.  If the characters get dumb, we can trust our good government to hurl them into space.\n\nOr maybe we could move them onto a deserted island?  We could get a chance to enjoy *Survivor* in its purest form.  You get all the excitement of twenty something year old children braving the harsh elements by \u201cforming alliances\u201d without being haunted by the suspicion that these people are just eating KFC off camera.  Then when they are done with their stint on the island, just for *shiggles* we make them perform their favorite Maroon 5 song *acapella* for America.\n\nNow I *dare* you to tell me reality TV wouldn\u2019t be *awesome* in a dystopian totalitarian future.\n\n![I\u2019m eroding your country\u2019s values, and I might not even be a real squirrel](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JJJ9IczQBvY/T96MXsEqewI/AAAAAAAAA9I/pSQRoyMIUTQ/s1600/twiggy.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\n### Bad: Church would be weird\n\nI\u2019m a church going man.  While it is important to me that I get plugged into a consistent church community, I have a secret hobby that I entertain - I really like to church hop.  There\u2019s always plenty for your mind to do while sitting in a congregation you don\u2019t belong in.  The college student in me likes to critique and dissect the philosophy I\u2019m being exposed to, but I think I enjoy it most on behalf of the child in me.  I like to feel like a secret agent hiding behind enemy lines.\n\nThe most general thing I have gathered from church hopping is that churches are very different.  Imagining church life in context of a global government leads me to think it would be too hard to get rid of church all together. A global government responsible for keeping the peace of an entire planet of human beings would be more likely opt for stability over purity, which makes me thing that church would have to be a service that made everyone happy.  But you couldn\u2019t just rotate preachers or concatenate all the different services together.  Too many religions would be offended by the mere acknowledgement of certain others.  This isn\u2019t just Lutherans and Catholics in the same room, mind you.  We have to open pews for the Satanists, Mormons, and maybe even the people that stay for the \u201cweird\u201d part of your Yoga class.\n\nThe closest thing to a weekly religious experience that would fulfill all walks of spiritual life is everyone eating crackers and watching an episode of *Mister Roger\u2019s Neighborhood*.\n\n![Go ahead, comrade.  Confess your sins to merciful Lady Elaine.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wAU1F9z6bqM/UMt_PbX6hDI/AAAAAAAAJZg/uALBxNK6Bpg/s1600/elaine.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\n# Bad: Single-ply toilet paper\n\nMaybe I\u2019m getting paranoid with this one, but I have a hunch that no one in this new world would ever feel the soft caress of triple ply toilet paper ever again.  Toilet paper seems like the first budget cut any huge system makes when it is in a pinch.\n\nWhenever I picture myself as a corrupt dictator or shady politician, I imagine that my vice would be good toilet paper.  I would get elected on the grounds of financial reform, anger my citizens with outrageous regulations on toilet paper production, then get caught accepting foreign TP as a bribe.\n\nThey would call my scandal *Charmingate*.\n\nBut my fantasy of infamy aside, I have a well-grounded suspicion that a universal totalitarian government would have little-to-no incentive to even double ply things for us.\n\n<br>\n\n# Bad: V for Vendetta would be even more popular\n\n*V for Vendetta* wasn\u2019t a bad movie.  I saw it, and I even liked it.  But for me it had the same fatal flaw as *Napoleon Dynamite*.  I didn\u2019t get sick of it until I met the people who *loved* it.\n\nIts fans covered dorm room walls in posters.  The derailed decent class discussions with references.  Many of these fans even took things to an entirely new level, donning that silly white mask in public as part of public protest.\n\nWhat has always kind of baffled me about these \u201cV\u201d inspired marches is how out of context they can be.  I imagine someone marching in defiance of a totalitarian American government that stifles human value and creativity has to walk past a decent number of indy coffee shops, art museums, and liberal colleges.  Things are still pretty good, compared to the government in the film.  Does our situation really seem that similar to the movie?\n\nWhich is why I think one of the suckiest parts of a totalitarian government would be the film\u2019s villain being actualized.  Every *V for Vendetta* fan would be quivering with Christmas morning excitement.  Do we have enough room on this earth for all the new movie posters that would come up?  Can we make enough masks for all the new 13 year old \u201chacktivists\u201d that would take to the streets?\n\n![Foot soldiers by day.

For such the sensation that this generation y born cult seems to be cracked up to be, the documentary felt lacking.  I expected something a little more vile, nauseating, and fun to watch.  For a documentary, it wasn\u2019t bad.  I wouldn\u2019t keep you from watching it on your own time on, say, a Sunday afternoon that [insert popular sports team here] isn\u2019t thrashing the [insert unpopular sports team here].  Maybe as one of those educational naps I know you take while you burn through your queue of *Planet Earth* episodes.  As I said, the film isn\u2019t as inflammatory as these things always seem to want to be.  It\u2019s informative in the purest sense.\n\n\n# Background: What\u2019s a *Brony*?\nIf you aren\u2019t the type to take naps on Sunday and you couldn\u2019t possibly fit a two hour Netflix original documentary in your day, I can provide a bit of background.\n\n*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* is a cartoon reboot of a slightly older storyline which features the adorable virtuous wanderings of talking ponies.  It isn\u2019t one of those witty cartoons filled with all kinds of double talk for the benefit of babysitters and parents.  In fact, the reboot set sail for the sole purpose of rekindling interest in Hasbro\u2019s line of *MLP* toys, unmistakably [targeted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic#origin) to young girls.\n\n![Pictured: Nothing cynical at all](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/pony.jpg)\n\nPeople generally have no issue with the show.  It\u2019s the new crop up of male twenty-something fans that bother them.  The show has recently attracted large numbers of male viewers that proudly don themselves *bronies* (a reduction of *bro* and *ponies*) to distinguish themselves from the little girls the show targets.\n\nThough the typical *brony* is often accused of a perverted satisfaction, their public explanation for their taking to a show about ponies is in the show\u2019s innocence.  These ponies are simple entertainment, teaching good lessons in front of a back drop of pure optimism.\n\nThese people are organized.  They have a vibrant community that backs an annual [*BronyCon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BronyCon) that has been expanding in participation since 2011.  At these conventions, *bronies* \u201ccosplay\u201d (dress as) their favorite pony characters from the show or fan fiction spin-offs of their own.\n\n# The Typical Brony\nThe more - *traditional* - of us insist that all stereotypes exist because at some point, they were true.  That\u2019s another Internet fight for another time, but it stands within reason when depicting your typical *brony*.\n\n<br>\n\n**The Fedora**\n\nA *Fedora* (or *trilby*, depending on who you are talking to) is a creased, pointed hat that was most popular in the Rat-pack days.  For whatever reason, *bronies* have proudly associated themselves to the Fedora.  But the ridicule received isn\u2019t *just* because they wear a Fedora.  The *brony\u2019s* Fedora is a synecdoche pointing to a much more deleterious lack of self-awareness.  This extends into sense of fashion, abolishment of social barriers, and an overall prohibition from allowing yourself to look ridiculous.  The idea is that anyone who thinks they look *classy* in a Fedora must have a completely skewed and irreparable self-image - almost like if you were to think wearing a refurbished set of fifth century Spartan armor in public would make you look tough.\n\n![Fedorable qualities intensify](http://i.imgur.com/RtlExLR.gif)\n\n<br>\n\n**The \u201cSwarthiness\u201d**\n\n\u201cSwarthiness\u201d is a great word, isn\u2019t it?  It almost qualifies as *onomatopoeia* - if grossness could make a sound, it would probably be *swarth-swarth-swarth*.  It also plays upon your suspicious of what a twenty-year-old-something who watches a cartoon show for girls would look like.\n\nI try not to objectify people, but *bronies* tend to objectively look gross.  The propagandist\u2019s depiction includes a hairy, busty gut, sparse but oily facial hair, and plenty of acne to go around.\n\nNone of these are *needed* to be a *brony*.  Their are enough cases of firefighters, football players, and straight-up beautiful male specimens that march under their *Twilight Sparkle* banner.  But samples of the stereotype in general population seem to inconspicuously *spike* wherever BronyCon is held.\n\n<br>\n\n**The Friend-Zone**\n\nThis associative metaphor isn\u2019t as tight and fast as the other two, but if you wear a Fedora you more than likely talk often about the dreaded \u201cFriend-Zone\u201d.  This is a metaphysical place for failure in pursuing a woman (i.e., she forever sees you as just a \u201cFriend\u201d).\n\nThe \u201cFriend-Zone\u201d gets associated with bronies because of their sensitivity.  Since they have such an affinity for positivity and innocence, their \u2018game\u2019 (in terms of \u201cscoring\u201d a girl) involves a lot of empathy, listening, and relating with females.  It\u2019s easy to see why a guy who constantly relates to you would make a great \u2018friend\u2019 - but inevitably the last thing that would come to mind would be his sexual needs.  After all, you were too busy reflecting on how sensitive he is to even remember he was anything like your typical horny, feel-copping late teen male.  Because a brony's overcompensating sensitive side, they are often placed in the Friend-Zone.\n\n# Brony Hate\nWe get it - these people are weird.  If someone in their right mind actually enjoyed this show, they would hide the episodes on encrypted hard drive in a folder labeled ```TAX STUFF```.\n\nBut the brony doesn\u2019t really fascinate me.  I practice *to each his own*.  Cartoon ponies are just not my cup of tea - albeit a rank and unusual cup of tea.\n\nWhat *does* interest me is in how much *brony hate* there is on the Internet.  It\u2019s arguably easier to find hate blogs, mock-memes and troll-sites than it is to find opportunities for earnest *brony* fellowship.\n\nThe edgy web comic *Cyanide & Happiness* touched on the subjected in their playful, intentionally cruel explanation for the recent budding of *bronies* as a social caste.  It\u2019s worth a good read:\n\n![](http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Dave/bulliesbullyingbullies1.png)\n\nPoignant.  Ironic.  Totally crass.  This is your typical C&H strip right here.  But the comic became a conscious summary of brony hate.  I saw this strip tossed around way more often than the other C&H comics.  It struck a nerve.  It seemed as if people who hate bronies laid a sort of *allegiance* behind it.\n\n# Interpreting this Like an Evolutionst\nAllow me to wear my \u201cCharles Darwin\u201d hat (and maybe even by Freud Pants).  I can\u2019t help but notice a naturalist component to this hatred of bronies.  Just what do you call that mixture of sympathy, embarrassment, and anger for another human\u2019s pathetic exhibition of shortcomings?  I don\u2019t really know the name for it either, but I\u2019m pretty sure it has something to do with Evolution.\n\nA central principal of the evolutionary model is that the fittest deserve to survive.  The best hunters, jumpers, and swimmers deserve to have their choice attributes represented in the next genetic batch.\n\nAn implication of this central principal is that the fittest surviving is also central in our *value* system.  We also desire to have the best of our species live on.  It\u2019s arguably the reason we meekly label super models as *out of our league* and categorically subjugate ourselves to those brilliant kids in our science classes.  We acknowledge the natural pecking order based on ability.\n\nExtending into entertainment, it\u2019s why we enjoy shows like *American Idol* - not the boring seasons where every contestant left can do a decent number.  I\u2019m talking about the unbearably awkward preliminary tryouts, fed by an endless single file line of socially inept and hopelessly untalented oddballs and wierdos.  Watching them gloat of their unique abilities only to croak *Wonderwall* before a dickish British guy gives us pleasure because it enforces our natural sense of the relationship of abilities with prestige.  The strongest survive.  It\u2019s just as fun to watch an unshakably cool, collected Philip Phillips rise to the top as it is to watch the *SHE BANG* guy not own up to his promised title wave of talent.\n\nAs it gives us pleasure to watch this law of the jungle shatter the dreams of the undeserving, it would have to really stress us out to watch the undeserving reject it.  It\u2019s one thing if we hear of a thirty-year old dude working his beat at Subway and spending his down time entertaining is misplaced interest in *My Little Pony*.  That\u2019s just a sad story.  But when we hear of hoards of these men *embracing* their hobby and even naming it, the primordial hairs on the back of our neck laboriously preened by Charles Darwin can\u2019t help but bristle a bit.\n\nWe try not to judge.  We have no reason to.  After all, what does the decisions that our Subway guy makes beyond how long to leave our Spicy Italian in the oven have to do with us and the way we live our lives?  Nothing.  So the brony hate must be coming from a much deeper pride for the human race.  We want to see pathetic people rally behind their weakness, hit the gym, and finally start becoming the sexually-threatening male acquaintance they were always meant to be.\n\nI suspect this applies beyond just *brony* hate.  The same could be said about all judgment casted at Second-Life gamers, Magic the Gatherers, Mac users, and all other social outcasts walking among us.\n\n# Conclusion\nI don\u2019t mean to defend *My Little Pony*.  Although I might be a little condescending toward these people, I didn\u2019t mean to bash them either.  My scrutinizing eye, dear reader, looks at you this time.  Whenever you find yourself frantically querying YouTube for videos of people that *just make you sick*, examine your hate.  Is it a thoughtful, constructive criticism, or do you echo the bestial breast beating of a much harrier, more honest ancestor of yours?", "description": "Bronies are all over the Internet, as well as the people who hate them.

Today, we are going to talk about style.  I don\u2019t mean the standard Isaac Mizrahi kind.  In no way am I qualified to do that.  I hope I don\u2019t lose 80% of you when I say this, but I have a few notes on programming style.  You can take me at my word that I am very comfortable with the possibility that I am walking around in a world where some people think programming is stupid.  I would never try to shove anything that tastes like math class down your throat.  I totally get it.  I won\u2019t eat red onions or listen to Maroon 5.  But I wouldn\u2019t bring you something from the world of programming if I didn\u2019t think you would benefit from it in your world.\n\n# I suck at programming\nI\u2019m objectively still a horrible programmer.  Up past my junior year of college, I didn\u2019t use my Macbook Pro for anything beyond something to charge my phone with.   I picked up most things in a late night frenzy when I should have been studying for something more closely related to my diploma.  I made a lot of assumptions, developed a lot of habits, and tread with haste through the quiet, sacred temples of human-computer interface.\n\nConsequently, I received a lot of criticism for the way I code - as I totally should have.  That\u2019s the best way to learn.  At my work, we do all our programming in pairs.  Generally, one engineer \u201cdrives\u201d, while the other acts as the \u201cspotter\u201d.  If you are one of those people who take criticism personally, the practice would no doubt send you into a frenzy.  Imagine someone sitting over your shoulder pointing out all your typos while you are proofreading somebody\u2019s Algebra II homework, and you are pretty much there.  If you are like me, however, that doesn\u2019t sound so bad.  I think you should have no problem defending your cool, calm, collected self when you are right about something, just as long as you realize you yourself can make mistakes too.  Working in pairs is a lot of fun once you get comfortable with the idea that you are probably going to be wrong 50% of the time.\n\nBut I digress.  I was talking about programming style.  While another programmer is working, the only reason his parter should interrupt him is if he uses *bad style*.\n\nSo what\u2019s wrong?  Not enough emoticons?  Too many 1's and not enough 0's?  Good programming style is difficult to define in a vacuum, but everyone can spot it when it's not observed.  Bad style is simply *code that could be better*.\n\nSilly variable names, being inconsistent, showboating an obscure function you learned - most people agree that these are all bad style.  Just take a look at my Comp Sci 101 homework while I was going through... a phase...\n\n    import java.util.*;\n    public class AlexIO {\n\n        public static int getInt(String prompt){\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n            int ireallymisstheshowjohnnybravoiwonderificanfindfreecopiesofitonline = 0;\n            boolean error=true;\n            while (error){\n                error=false;\n                System.out.print(prompt);\n                try {\n                    ireallymisstheshowjohnnybravoiwonderificanfindfreecopiesofitonline = sc.nextInt();\n                } catch (InputMismatchException e){\n                    sc.nextLine();\n                    System.out.println(\"Stop screwing around.\");\n                    error=true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return ireallymisstheshowjohnnybravoiwonderificanfindfreecopiesofitonline;\n\n        }\n\n        public static String getString(String prompt){\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n            String heySnyder=null;\n            boolean error=true;\n            while (error){\n                error=false;\n                System.out.print(prompt);\n                try {\n                    heySnyder = sc.nextLine();\n                } catch (InputMismatchException e){\n                    sc.nextLine();\n                    System.out.println(\"Stop screwing around.\");\n                    error=true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return heySnyder;\n\n        }\n\n        public static double getDouble(String prompt){\n            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n            double sexyBeast=0;\n            boolean jerrySeinfeld=true;\n            while (jerrySeinfeld){\n                jerrySeinfeld=false;\n                System.out.print(prompt);\n                try {\n                    sexyBeast = sc.nextDouble();\n                } catch (InputMismatchException NEWMAN){\n                    sc.nextLine();\n                    System.out.println(\"Cut it out!\");\n                    jerrySeinfeld=true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return sexyBeast;\n\n        }\n \n    }\n\nGod bless my patient, saint of a TA.  Here is the moral of the story: programs that could be written better constitute *bad style*.  For whatever reason, they don\u2019t get the job done effectively.  My arrogant mess above was a simple group of functions meant to get console input from a user.  Instead of returning variables named after friends, celebrities, and lost cartoons, I could have just used normal words and saved a programmer several minutes of precious mental effort.\n\nEveryone can simply point out when things could be better, but things get interesting when you ask them to elaborate.  Let\u2019s take the example above and bring it before two seasoned programmers (it would have been three, but the third hung himself when he heard I was hired out of college).\n\n**Programmer 1:**\n\n> This is a horrible program.  My first thought is maintainability.  Say this code makes it into a much larger program and goes unnoticed for years.  If there ever came a time where it needed to be modified, the silly variable names would confuse the program flow and make it harder to comprehend.  Precious man hours would be spent trying to understand a program that could have been written more efficiently.  Meanwhile, bugs are occurring, data is corrupted, and it gets increasingly more difficult to improve.  Bad style.\n\nYikes.  That was harsh.  He must be one of those guys who is *functionally* driven.  Everything is about the amount of work it will take to maintain something.  Programmer 1 is offended at how much time will be wasted trying to figure out what the original programmer meant.  Let\u2019s hear from programmer 2.\n\n**Programmer 2:**\n> This is a joke right?  Of course it\u2019s terrible.  I don\u2019t know what he is talking about.  He is clearly having fun, but if only he knew how many people would be depending on this program!  I feel like the author wasted an opportunity to come up with a more readable, elegant solution.  This is just bad style.  Here, let me show you a better way.\n\nThe difference is subtle - perhaps a little too subtle for my role-playing to capture.  But what I was trying to show was the difference between the functional programmer\u2019s and idealist programmer's concerns.  Programmer 1 was a *functionalist*.  Good code saves time for everyone.  That\u2019s why you automate things in the first place, right?  Good style means code that can be easily read, fixed, and transported.\n\nProgrammer 2 was an idealist.  He was more perturbed at how awkward and unclear my program was.  He found it inconsistent, redundant, and pedagogically worthless.  Furthermore, he was quick to offer a more concise and mathematically beautiful way of solving the same problem for someone.\n\nBoth programmer\u2019s have no problem disqualifying the same kind of code under the pretense of *bad style*.  Their reasons, however, vary.\n\n# My philosophy hat\nI use to hang out with two philosophy majors who were about a star\u2019s weight more thoughtful than I was.  Whenever we were up late talking about something and I wanted to contribute something ridiculous, I would jokingly prequel it with \u201cAllow me to wear my philosophy hat for a second...\u201d.  This meant that if what I said was cool, it ought to be taken seriously, but if it was totally off, they should refrain from making fun of me because I don\u2019t actually study philosophy.\n\nThis time, reader, I tip my philosophy hat to you.  This whole *functional vs ideal* thing reminds me of something I think I may have learned.\n\nThe topic of pragmatism vs idealism steers the discussion of morality.  It is nicely parallel with the discussion of programming style we are having today.  Are we moral people simply because our society *functions* better that way?  Admittedly, Christmas shopping and visiting the post office goes much more smoothly when murder and arson are discouraged.  I\u2019ve always assumed that whenever a BestBuy employee refrains from murdering me, it\u2019s mostly because he doesn\u2019t want to get my blood all over his khakis.  There is a great deal of truth to this - our society works better when we follow rules.  Children are happier when their parents are faithful to each other, employees keep their jobs when companies don\u2019t commit crimes... the functional argument works.\n\nLikewise, a good amount of us practice morality because we are following a standard.  We have a good idea of what a perfect and moral life looks like, and we measure our own morality by a perfect standard.  When we fall short, we are dismayed at the wasted opportunity to become a little more like our standard of perfection.\n\nThe division in programming is compelling - especially when you find languages that radically lean to one side over the other.\n\nI like to work a lot in a language called *python*.  One thing that is unique about it is that *indenting* matters.  Each nested operation is indented by 4 spaces.  If 3, 5, or a standard *tab* is used instead, your program crashes.  This ensures that all programs are written the same way - readable and consistent.  The language is also rolled together with *The Zen of Python*, which are rules the perfect program must follow.\n\nPython is heavily idealistic.  Bad style is a program that fails to be *pythonic* (don\u2019t say that to a C++ developer.  You may get kicked in the groin).\n\n![\u2018There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are Dutch.\u2019 -Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/~guido/images/IMG_2192.jpg)\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum is *Haskell*.  I took a tour in the language about a week ago.  Haskell is purely functional.  Variables cannot change in an expression until it has finished evaluating. One liners, recursion, and mathematical sequences are favored.\n\n# Conclusion\nOkay, okay - my philosophy hat is coming off now.  I just found the comparison amusing.  I continue to receive code style critiques, but now (as sort of a personal curiosity) I take a bit of extra time to extract *why* my program exhibits bad style.  Some of us are functionals.  Some of us are idealists.  Some of us are an ongoing bare-knuckle boxing match of both.  Which one are you?", "description": "Style talk - programming style that is.

I have seen plenty of movies since my last movie review, but it takes a really special movie experience to get me to write about it.\n\nAs always, I don't apologize for spoilers.  But this time, ironically, I don't think I *could* spoil anything about this film if I tried.  The film uses so many clich\u00e9s that, in a way, you have *already* seen it.\n\nSo gird up your loins, ready your flanks, and add a little more oil to those biceps, dear reader.  This is going to be a bloody one.\n\n# Everyone speaks with British accents\n\nThe film opens with a breath-taking pan of Ancient Greece.  Just in case we couldn't ascertain that from an obvious view of the Acropolis, the Colusseum, and white people feeding each other grapes (or distinguish it from Las Vegas), the specifics of every intended setting flash across the screen in tasteful *Papyrus* MS font.  This was no doubt a personal touch from one of the producers of *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* that stuck around for the shooting of this movie.\n\n![No - it's not a plug for the nearest Greek restaurant.  It\u2019s supposed to be informative.](http://www.skhs.net/assets/images/dept/50/rest2012GreekMenu2.jpg).\n \nThough we are clearly supposed to be somewhere in ancient Macedonia, everyone talks with that old sounding British accent.  Some characters even go as far as forcing the Cockney variation.  The vulnerable, admiring child actor that followed Hercules around could have stood in for Tiny Tim.\n\nWhy do films do this?  Why is a British accent the only way to make people sound like they belong in any date precluding 1900?  Lucky for them, my feudal system era history must be as fuzzy as theirs.  I had no trouble forgiving the strange accents once I was immersed in the gripping dialog.\n\n# The Rock always carries a stick\n\nI could describe to you how 'The Rock' played the part of the son of Zeus, or I could save you time and just describe how 'The Rock' plays anybody.  He is always a venerated, but tired war hero.  Despite his street cred, he unapologetically recites his plight as just a 'regular guy trying to be with his wife and kids'.\n\nTake the movie 'Walking Tall'.   The Rock is clearly known as the 'get business done' guy.  He is clearly the most physically imposing character in the town, but everyone knows he is just a regular guy trying to hang out with his family.  Bad guys come in (either crooked cops or hilariously dehumanizing entrepenuers... I don't remember), and Dwayne is forced to destroy them all.\n\nOh yeah, and he always carries a big piece of wood.\n\n![I hear 'carry a big stick' was the only thing written down in his high school history notebook.](http://i.imgur.com/3lqo2E7.jpg)\n\nIn the provided context, Hercules may as well be whatever the *Walking Tall* guy's name was.  He is a grizzled, weary mercenary who just wants to live in peace and hang out with his wife and -- *ah*.  Forgot.  They're dead.  But there were so many flashbacks of them, I feel like I knew them as well as he did.\n\nThe Rock did OK, comparatively.  He had a decent British accent, and he even went through the trouble of growing his hair out like Jesus.  With that kind of haircut, it doesn't matter if you hire Tom Cruise, Christian Bale, or The Rock.  They are all going to seem the same - until they start talking.\n\n![Thanks to the hair, these actors are completely interchangeable for any male protagonist living from 4000 BC to AD 1200](http://i.imgur.com/gmRGaYz.jpg)\n\n# More clich\u00e9s\n\nFollowing Hercules\u2019 dramatic introduction was an unending slew of action movie clich\u00e9s.  There was a rag tag group of misfits, a greedy deserter that redeems himself at a critical time, and plenty of dirty faced peasant extras to stare at the camera as your hero passes in a chariot.\n\nThe movie even capitalized on some of the *Hunger Games* hype.  There was a saucy female archer - but lacking in Catniss, this one went to battle in a *poshe* animal hide mini skirt.  There is this *totally original* scene where a clueless, sexist King snidely remarks that the battle is *no place for a lady* - then BAM.  *Midriff Mc'Quiver* extemporaneously fires arrows in the courtroom.  How do they come up with this stuff?  \n\nThere was also plenty of hat tipping to my absolute favorite plot device: Hero gets in danger, bad guy slowly raises his weapon to kill him, then the bad guy keels over revealing a smirking supporting cast member.  Honestly, some \"battle scenes\" were just a ten minute long daisy chain of *this* scene.\n\n# Pretty much everything else\n\nSo Hercules is traveling around with his rugged band of misfits working as mercenaries.  A shady king hires them to attack some villages.  He does his best to train the sad peasants into men, and after a lengthy, rousing training montage, they learn one unbreakable tactic - hide behind your shields and wait until The Rock kills everyone.\n\nThe freshly trained army steps into a trap wrought by half naked, slippery demon people.  They attack the Rock with scythes, which is undoubtedly symbolism for residual communist phobia in America.  They eventually ward them off and do a couple more battles.  Just after their final victory, the soundtrack introduces a strange, guilty feeling.  Apparently, The Rock and his men have been helping a king take over innocent towns all along.  The Rock feels immensly guilty for aiding in such injustice, then throws a hissy fit in the middle of a royal feast.  The crew reluctantly take their cut of the conquest and leaves.  It is then that he inspires his men to get revenge on the king for his betrayal and just, you know, kill all of them or something.\n\nMy question is this - why does a man who has been supposedly working as a famed mercenary for decades have a fifth grader's understanding of the consequences of war?  It's not like the evil king did anything completely unexpected or cruel after he captured the rivaling city.  He just sort of laughed maniacally while Hercules stared at him.\n\n!['Man I love war.  I hope there are no negative social consequences though.'](http://www.marcusbronzy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2014/07/hercules-dwayne-johnson-600x271.jpg)\n\nThe rest is a heroic cascade of feel good filmography.  It turns out that Hercules did himself a favor when he taught the army to do nothing but hide behind their shields.  Three mangled guard dogs, four tipped cauldrons, one broken statue, and one dead supporting actor later and everything is right as rain.  The army Hercules trained embraced him as their mighty leader (after watching him kill about a third of them, I would too).  We also got to see the sleazy traitor guy swoop in to save the day (though he didn't *woop* like Han Solo did, which was disappointing).\n\n# The meaning of Greece, myth, and life\n\nAfter all the bad guys died, all that was left to do is close the book on mighty Hercules, who presumably went on to spend the rest of his life carousing with hairy men and conceiving hundreds of children with their wives.  The movie ends with a very special summary of Greek mythology - *be yourself*.  That's all those stupid poets were trying to say.  It doesn't matter whether you are a god, a centaur, or a Friday night Smackdown headliner.  What makes a hero is someone who isn't afraid to be themselves.\n\nOddly, I am OK with this.  To their credit, the movie was what they wanted it to be.  It was ignorantly fun.  I didn't pay 11.50 to experience the under-appreciated nuances of Athenian culture.  I was just there to see Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson ride a Hydra.

Honestly, I don\u2019t think I deserve a blog.  The idea came to me during an experiment I tried earlier this summer.  For the first half hour of every morning, to help myself wake up, I wrote a thousand words at the computer.  The ultimate aim was to become a more articulate person.  At the very least, my goal was to minimize the amount of time I practice telling stories and riffs in the shower so I can  focus more on showering.  Clearly, my main objective was cleanliness.\n\nWhat this morning blogging turned into was declassified, inauthentic, gibberish-soaked griping.  I was usually too tired to remember what I had already written about, and I cared far too less to refine anything.  Basically, I didn\u2019t want to leave several million words, written in private, all complaining about internet explorer or how hard it is to open up a macbook air.\n\nI\u2019ve always hated bloggers.  The first thing I think of when I hit a new blog is \u201cWhy do you think you deserve a blog?\u201d  Admit it, you have asked that of me at every paragraph break so far.  Hopefully I can win back some of your trust, knowing that I have had these thoughts too.  And so, brace for ego.\n\nI do have rules, you know.  I\u2019m not advertising on Facebook.  I\u2019m not spending an entire weekend on the theme of my wordpress layout or trying to get it to show up on google when you type my first and last name.  I\u2019m aiming for what I was before with my dumb little morning write-a-thon experiment \u2013 with the added subtle accountability of a possible reader.\n\nFrom your point of view, it\u2019s a list of wins.  Now, I can\u2019t get away with saying the same thing to four different people throughout the day, trusting they won\u2019t sync up and realize I am kind of a phony when it comes to talking points (and it\u2019s not just *one* thing to *four* of you \u2013 during a good week, I feel like it\u2019s *dozens of things* to - well -  *all of you*).

Forget that they are arranged in a bizarrely clean storage container (with no trace of human interaction at all).  This is a stock photo - you are not supposed to ask questions.\n\nMy degree is in chemistry.  I state this half for those who don't know, and half as a reminder to myself.  I had a bit of an identity crisis the other day.  See - the type of chemistry I focused my attention on was Organic - *Breaking Bad Chemistry*, as it's known more formally.  I didn't deal with a lot of colorful liquids myself, but I have enough of a science background to make people feel comfortable lobbing random street drug, pharmaceutical, and Jesse Pinkman related questions.\n\nThe other day at work, someone asked me if the compound Penicillin was *tricyclic*.  I froze.  I had no idea.  What did *tricyclic* mean?  I was drawing a complete blank.  It wasn't like it was an incredibly obscure masters-level question to ask.  Any schlub in first semester organic chemistry would be able to zip that up without touching a single flashcard.\n\n![Cmon!  Penicilin?  Tricyclic?.  Answer me, B#@!%](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/jessie.jpg)\n\nWhich is why it was so humbling to draw a blank.  Luckily - I had Dr. Wikipedia on another tab, so I avoided looking stupid for now.  But an identity crisis germinated upon realizing that I am starting to forget things - things that I promised myself I would never forget.  I loved organic chemistry.  Even when I decided to move in another direction for my life.  I vowed that I would always keep a sliver of my heart tender for the lab that raised me.\n\n# Nostalgia in the lab\n\nSome of my fondest memories took place in the research lab.  During my Junior year, I assisted a professor with a synthetic chemical project.  I'm not sure how much I'm actually allowed to share (you could say that's classified - *ladies*), but I was fortunate because I got to work with a lot of vanilla.  Beakers, jars, and bags of vanilla.  Eventually, I was even finding it in my pockets.\n\nI consider myself lucky that I was placed on a project with vanilla, given most things in organic chemistry smell like old food and mouse turds.  We usually save the more fragrant, colorful reactions for intro students, but the reality is most research reactions resemble too closely digging around for a piece of broken glass in a slurry of something that was leaking out of your car.  You have to appreciate the moments you see something beautiful - like a crystal, colorful vapor, or a dangerous explosion.\n\n![Molten garbage is an aquired taste.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/slurry.jpg)\n\nWorking long hours by yourself, you start to go a little nuts.  And trapped in a tiny room filled with dangerous toys, could you blame me?  I'll confess to you - the most dangerous thing I ever did was light a piece of magnesium tape on fire.  It's a demo that pretty much every fifth grader can speak to, but it was still fun to do it by myself.\n\nWorking alone also makes one think more about death.  Particulary, what music I would be comfortable to have playing if someone were to discover my dead body in the morning.  I actually made two music playlists because of these reflections.  I had one playlist of finer, reputable music.  I would listen to this list whenever I was doing something dangerous - whenever high pressure, caustic chemicals or fire were involved.  I figured that way, if something horrible were to happen and my corpse was found the next morning in a seething puddle of *Diisobutylaluminium hydride*, the witness would at least know that I had good taste.  I kept all my Katy Perry, Waka Flocka Flame, and Wiz Khalifa on the other playlist.  This was more routine operations where I was farely certain my life wasn't in danger.\n\n![We believe there to be foul play here, commisioner.  The carbon monoxide posinoning was exacerbated by the inhuman amount of captain crunch forcibly stuffed in his mouth.  Also, the killer must have mockingly played Ke$ha as he died.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/murder.jpg)\n\n# Teacher's Pet\n\nAlong with helping out in the research lab, I spent a few semesters aiding an organic chemistry lab.  I was *that* TA.  The TA that thinks he is working the ICU of the Mayo clinic, overseeing the Apollo 13 disaster, or simply that he is almighty god himself.\n\n![I was looking for the IUPAC name, you peon.  Here, I'll write it for you on my pecs.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/douchebag.jpg)\n\nAs the semesters went on, I grew a heart for the underdogs and began grading a little easier.  I appreciated the work ethic of the geniuses that would pass through, but the students that were right on the edge of giving up on everything really got to me.  For most people that go through the class, they are not looking to linger.  They carry themselves like Liam Neeson in *The Grey* - hard as stone and comfortable with every tribulation until death itself - only to presumably wrestle with wretching doubt behind closed doors.  The moments you can pick someone up off the ground and walk them back to the path they left is rewarding enough to pay for the job without the ritzy eight bucks an hour.\n\nI wish I did this more often, but here is a little album I made of everyone on the last lab of the semester.  It was a pretty big experiment in which you synthesize lidocane (a cousin of novicane) bascially from scratch.  Great work everyone.  I hope you are on to bigger and better endeavors then amateur local anesthetics.\n\n(sorry if I missed anyone.  I think I may have lost some photos - just let me know if you are conspicuously missing so you can receive your rightful accolades)\n\n<iframe class=\"imgur-album\" width=\"auto\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://imgur.com/a/2oTSM/embed\"></iframe>\n\n# The problem with analogies\n\nHelping out in lab was humbling because I saw so many students that were better scientists than me.  I did ok, but I fear it was for the wrong reasons.\n\nAs a confused human being, I rely heavily on analogies.  They are usually good, but they are still analogies.  Since no analogy is perfect, it is perfectly necessary to incriminate an understanding built *entirely* on analogies as being *far* from perfect.  That's just math.\n\nA good scientist is someone who always has an analogy ready, but hesitates for the sake of principle - the principle being a deep respect for reality itself.  This is why, I believe, teachers save the analogies for the end, or strictly for the after-class asides with the students who are struggling.  Scientists have a deep respect for reality itself.  If you think about it, learning soley through comparison with things you already know can be a sad, backwards way to move through a collegiate education if you abuse it.\n\nAnd believe me - I abused it.  Everything was an analogy in my head.  Most of them were too embarassing to share with the class, but they worked.  They were good.  Generally, the less math surrounding the subject the better.  Organic chemistry was the perfect underground for my seedy trick.  It was built heavily on cause-effect relationships, and there was no honest math to keep me in line.\n\nThings worked for a while, but my rouse broke down when I got to more serious classes.  This is what forced me to realize that I really wasn't learning science *scientifically*.  I was just learning it programatically.\n\nContrary, programmers have absolutely no respect for reality.  Everything is an analogy.  We work with objects, classes, and methods that we name whatever the hell we want.  We are obnoxiously literal when *you* are incorrect and *unforgivably* general when we would like to be correct.  Programming frequently involves traversing oceans of rich information (most of which could occupy anyone for an entire lifetime of learning) only to kidnap the snippet of insight we need to move forward with our own project.  After we get what we need, we ```ctrl-c``` it out of the loving arms of its wikipedia contributors and close the tab - likey to never appreciate all the hardwork again.\n\nIt was no wonder I was drawn to it so much.  When you discover programming, you in parallel discover that you have been treating every other class you have ever taken as a programming language.  Everything is an analogy.  Everything is just an object.\n\nIt took some personal development to resign from science.  At one point, I really thought I was the only one doing things right.  Pragmatically, if you can get a lesser student to grasp a mechanic in a blip of the time it would take them to derrive it themselves (even if you have to compare the valence electron shell to The Jersey Shore), why not?\n\nOne summer, I even tried to publish a series of lectures promoted by the [University of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/universityofreddit/).  I got two videos into the curriculum before I had to stop.  I would have liked to keep moving forward, but the overhead of writing lectures and editing them for youtube was way too much.  Cutting the class short was heart-breaking - especially since the initial reaction to the videos was so positive.  I'm sorry, you guys.  I think it's better that you learn the right way.\n\n<iframe height=\"300\" width=\"width\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/fycCUfsIIzo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI have been tempted to write up the analogies I have left.  They are close to my heart, and it would be a bold face lie if I said I wasn't a little proud of them.  I have been flirting with the idea of posting a small blog series covering \"Organic Chemistry explained disrespectfully\".  My sense of urgency to get it out of my head before it whithers in memory was heigtened this week by my *tricyclic spaceout*.  If I can forget something as simple as the number of cycles in a structure today, who knows what I can forget tomorrow.\n\n# Chemists are special people\n\nAll in all, working with chemists has given me a deep appreciation for those with the bravery to learn things the right way - the crazy ones.  Chemists are special people.  One of the mosts amusing things I've noticed is the uniformity in horrible posture throughout the chemistry department.  Everyone - from the dedicated sophomores to the tenured celebrites - walks with a crimp in their back.  If you are wondering, that is the kind of thing that happens when you spend hours upon hours counting drops into a vial over a bench.  But dually, I see it as a beautiful *synecdoche* pointing to the humility this kind of attention to detailed reality leaves you with.  Chemists are some of the most delicate people, but it's hard to miss the unshakeable strength that confounds the quiet, calculated impression.\n\nTo my peers that went on without me, I wish you well.  I have a feeling every single one of the chemists I graduated with is going to do amazing things.  I am proud to have worked with so many of you and grateful for the teachers that poured themselves out for the sake of my experience.\n\nHere is a video that I'm sure most people have seen.  Consider it my toast to all the scientists better than I.  Cheers!\n\n<iframe height=\"300\" width=\"auto\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1ZPG70mT11I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>", "description": "Blanking on a chemistry question this week spurred an identity crisis, a Breaking Bad reference, and a tender look back on all the chemists that have been a part of my life.", "title": "Chemistry", "image_url": "http://media.alexrecker.com/images/chemistry.jpg", "published": true, "date": "2014-04-25", "slug": "chemistry"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 32}, {"fields": {"body": "I have to apologize, dear reader, for my lack of output lately.  It was all just bad timing.  First, I decided to update every other week.  I\u2019m still trying to find a good balance in frequency of updating \u2013 not as much as a twitter feed and a bit more often than Haley\u2019s Comet.\n\nSecondly, I got sick.  And if you think I was actually sick enough to warrant your sympathy, step back.  I\u2019m in full realization that I\u2019m a man, and I completely shut down when I get a mere common cold.  My recovery for even the smallest throat tickle always involves unplugging everything in the house that uses electricity, then lying alone in bed in my favorite hoodie, whimpering into the silence until my disease passes.  When I get the strength to move, I walk to the sink and drink three gallons of tap water, than wait until I have to pee.\n\nThirdly, I was ushered off by my work place to attend a training seminar.  I wasn\u2019t allowed to use my phone (and my covert phone time was taken up by trying to beat my fiance\u2019s high score in [Minion Rush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Hfdjg4FGM) \u2013 priorities).\n\nLeaving me here.  At least a few weeks from my last post.  Well here I am, dear reader \u2013 I\u2019m back from the dead and ready to tell you that I am\u2026 surviving.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be so melodramatic.  By that, I mean the honeymoon phase of living on my own is starting to wear off.  It\u2019s getting harder and harder to become enthralled by the little things (like owning my own set of keys, or having a tiny mailbox with my name on it) when bills start to roll in and things start breaking.  I am convinced that not a single closet in my apartment closes right \u2013 which makes me wonder whether or not I have been opening doors wrong my whole life.\n\nSpeaking of flaky blogging, Ben Parks [updated his piece](http://benjaminnparks.blogspot.com/2013/10/yeah-yeah-i-know-i-said-i-would.html) this week with a rundown of his daily routine.  I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on him.  Necessarily, when he has the time to update, you know it must be somehow important.  Inspired by a peer, I have decided to do the same.\n\n<br>\n\n* 6:30 AM \u2013 Sit up and stare out my window.  I also take the time to clear my throat about a hundred times\n* 6:40 \u2013 Walk to the bathroom and sit there naked holding my arm out into the shower.  I\u2019ve always felt this scene would make a really good risque watercolor painting\n* 6:50 \u2013 7:15 \u2013 Actually showering now.  I\u2019m not really sure why this takes so long.  I think I might be falling asleep or something.  Someone needs to tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong.\n* 7:20 \u2013 Rinse out a bowl in the sink and fill it with raisin bran.  Because it only takes me a minute or two to eat a bowl of cereal, I just continue to stand there and set it back in the sink when I\u2019m done.\n* 7:25 \u2013 Watch the Daily Show.  I have to do this in the morning because my Internet is 10X faster at this time.\n* 7:40 \u2013 Leave for work.  Sadly, my car doesn\u2019t begin to heat itself until I am fifteen minutes into the twenty minute drive.\n* 8:00 \u2013 4:00 \u2013 Working.  But I take breaks and stuff.  It\u2019s funny when you feel the need to take a break but you don\u2019t have anything to do.  Besides eating lunch, I usually walk around the building or do other people\u2019s dishes in the break room.\n* 4:05 \u2013 Power off the laptop, then drive to Target.  I buy a pack of trimmed asparagus and a red pepper, and maybe a bag of sunflower seeds if I am running low.  I like to take a while to pick out the pepper.  I squeeze it, hold it up to the light, and bounce it off the ground a few times as if I were really looking for something that would disqualify it.\n* 4:30 \u2013 Ideally, I like to go skateboarding while my single chicken breast thaws in cold water.\n* 5:15 \u2013 Cook dinner.  The chicken isn\u2019t too exciting, but I have really taken to making big, smoky stir fries in my enormous pan.  A fly on the wall will hear me shout at least a few times \u2018BAM!  Kick it up a notch\u2018 as I flavor the chicken with the only spice I own (and the only spice you really need)- cyan pepper.\n* 6:00 \u2013 Eat dinner.  I sit on a lawn chair and watch Pawn Stars on my 17 inch TV.  Also, don\u2019t tell my landlord that I am somehow getting the History Channel.\n* 7:00 \u2013 11:30 \u2013 I call this my time for chores, but let\u2019s be honest, it just turns into a lengthy Grand Theft Auto session.

Lately, between the man-handling of YouTube and the big updates to Hangouts, Google has been taking a lot of my attention.  Maybe some context first.\n\n### Early Frustrations\nThis time two years ago, I hated Google.  I was a noisy one man army who was the first to spit on everything they made.  All of the frustration was there, but I had absolutely nothing to back it up.  That is because this time two years ago, I also had no idea how to use a computer.  If a file wasn\u2019t on my desktop in an easily recognizable picture, it didn\u2019t exist.  The compass icon at the bottom of my mac dock was simply called \u201cthe internet\u201d.  No joke \u2013 I once deleted my entire iTunes library because I thought the folder looked unimportant.\n\n![You guys are doing it all wrong. The Internet is THIS one.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/safari.png)\n\nBut all of the frustration was still there.  And good frustrations lead to well-formed opinions.  After trying out Google Chrome in a dark closet far away from my more tech-savvy friends, I had to admit that it was pretty slick.  There were plenty more greener pastures for me in Google\u2019s meadow.  After signing up for Gmail, I no longer had to put up with having to clear unread emails on both my phone and my computer (and for my fellow cavemen still dwelling in the dark recesses of a Comcast email address, I\u2019d invite you to take your first hit of an IMAP capable inbox).  I\u2019ll be the first to admit that Google is just impressive in some things.  You should have seen me when I updated the Hangouts app on my phone \u2013 I was giggling like an anime heroine when I found that I could now smoothly handle SMS and MMS through my favorite messaging app.  The fact that I can set a calendar appointment with an address, causing Google to omnisciently offer to navigate me there promptly twenty-five minutes before a twenty-minute drive is slick.  We have all been impressed by Google, who has built a well-earned reputation of being the Thompson Tank of indexing web-driven data.\n\n![Google Now is like Siri \u2013 except it doesn\u2019t repeat everything you say - you know - like an idiot.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/google-now.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### The New Apple\nBut since when did Google users become the new Apple?  Maybe that\u2019s confusing.\n\nPretend for a second that I don\u2019t think Apple products suck (and if you didn\u2019t know that, just play with your smart phone for a minute or two while I stuff all the doves back into my coat sleeve).  To mac users out there \u2013 whenever you happen to be around computer people, do you ever get the impression that they just automatically don\u2019t like you?  Non-coincidentally, I\u2019d imagine it starts to set in soon after you out yourself with the sticker on your car or the time you let the phrase *cheapen the user experience* slip.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/applehaircut.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>User experience is too precious to be cheapened.  I\u2019m just wondering why you haven\u2019t printed this out and brought it to the lady that cuts your hair.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nBut maybe you do use Apple *and* you\u2019re not a douche about it.  I\u2019m all about someone using what works for them.  But my point is that Apple\u2019s advertising campaign is what gave you a bad reputation \u2013 which is earning you all kinds of smug passive aggression from everyone at Best Buy.\n\nPeople hate your company because it uses so many resources that *didn\u2019t* go into software to  focus on advertising.  It was clear Apple\u2019s chief agenda was to create a culture \u2013 a walled garden of individuals who always began any definition of themselves with their Apple ID and password \u2013 even if it meant cutting some corners and shipping some products out that just didn\u2019t work.  While the obvious *Think Different* slogan was a clear stance of aloofness from the beginning, even the fact that they wrote an operating system exclusive to their own hardware perpetuated the dogma that Apple thought they were special.\n\nIf I am hitting any nerves here, allow me to skip the pin-pricks and just cut straight to the epidural.  You are not unique because you use Apple products.  You are not creative because you use Apple products.  You do not think differently because you use Apple products.\n\nStop laughing, Google users.  I\u2019m just about to get to you.  In fact, the rhyme between this song of vanity and the one you guys are pitching is more rhythmic than you\u2019d like to admit.\n\nThe Google user pocket is [definitively wealthy](http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/20/technology/enterprise/google-states/), mainly [twenty-something year old males](http://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Google+-vs-Facebook.jpg).  Go ahead and do what I just did \u2013 take a minute to dig around the web for writers staking the claim that Google+ users are [smarter and nicer](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-just-nicer-2011-7) than everyone else (and no \u2013 I wasn\u2019t unfair with the wording.  I was actually just plagiarizing the title of the article I linked to).\n\nI hope Google continues to flex the muscles that brought them to the big time, but I\u2019m going to take an Internet minute here to call Google users out.  You are not smarter because you use Google.  Your relationships are not more meaningful because you use Google+.  You are not the only one who really needs email because you use Gmail.  You are not more aware because you use Google.\n\n<br>\n\n### The Fragmented Life\nGoogle\u2019s popular One Account.  All of Google philosophy comes to mind here.  It is Google\u2019s goal to fulfill every information and communication need you have -\n\n*So they can better advertise to you*.  You did know Google\u2019s primary income is coming from people who want to sell you things \u2013 don\u2019t you?  And you\u2019re aware that Google makes so much money because in the time you can check your email, search for the nearest drug store, and blast your No Strings Attached album in the privacy of your locked car, Google has already shown you a dozen products you don\u2019t yet own.  This an extremely tantalizing opportunity for companies who want you to buy things.  Why settle for a television commercial every twenty minutes that is easily circumvented by TiVo or a bathroom break.  Thanks to Google, the shakers can be a part of your every day life.  They are just as present when you RSVP to a wedding as they are when you are writing your research paper.\n\n*And they are learning about you*.  Every search, paste, link, and cookie with your IP address on it becomes a resource for teaching advertisers how to influence you.  In Google\u2019s world, you are the product.  The real customers go unnoticed \u2013 having access to more information than decades worth of surveys.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to be so dramatic.  I just have to say it \u2013 because so many people don\u2019t know this is Google\u2019s flagship enterprise.  They are not just being nice to you.  They don\u2019t care about your videos, school assignments, and calendar events.  This is just the bait to get you to see a product you don\u2019t yet own.\n\nBut I shouldn\u2019t be so dark about it.  I actually don\u2019t mind the extra set of eyes on my Amazon shopping if it means I don\u2019t have to ever see one of those *hot, sexy Christian singles* ads.  But mark my words, if you are going to sell my information, you better have some damn good bait to lure me in.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bedfeet.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Very subtle, Facebook. I know it was you because I listed myself as a Christian. I wonder if that\u2019s a heterosexual set of feet underneath those impeccably clean bedsheets.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n### To Each, Their Own\nWhich is, ultimately, my point.  If you are going to use a Google app or an iDevice, do it because it works for you.  If these people want to own your life and sell your information to all kinds of invisible demons and predators that are poisoning our culture from the gut out, make them work for it.  Don\u2019t buy into the culture: the reason Apple users are so special \u2013 the charm of a true Googler \u2013 the\u2026 musk\u2026 of an Internet Explorer.  The point is \u2013 don\u2019t be such a cheap product.  Choose your jersey before the game, but always be ready to jump ship.  Nobody owns you.  It\u2019s all about finding ways to make your life easier.\n\nSo Google is looking for the one unifying identity that brings everything together.  One account - right?  Google overlooked something.  The common denominator is you.  And you are so much bigger than what Google can index.  You are too unique to just be summarized under the quaint, easily-amused clan of *Googlers*.  You might use a mac to work on, but that\u2019s not what makes you really creative.  I\u2019m sick of seeing bumper stickers and company logo decals in place of beautiful handwriting, truly gifted multitaskers, and ideas so off-putting that they just can\u2019t be unoriginal.\n\nForget Google.  Forget Apple.  Forget Facebook.  Just get things done, and whatever can\u2019t keep up with you, throw it in the garbage next to your junkmail and the chicken breast you overcooked.\n\nOff the soapbox now.  Thank you for your attention, dear readers.

The awkward layout alone should be enought to tip you off to the fact that I've jumped ship to something a little more home brewed.\n\nI present to you my pet project.  It's a ghetto little markdown driven CMS I've hacked together - and it's the most organic thing to leave my kitchen since that spinache calzone (*aside* - brown spinach is bad spinach.  There - I've spared you the night long retching I endured to learn the same lesson just last weekend).\n\nThe new diggs are part of an effor to be more minimal.  I'm kind of trying to do the transcendentalism thing, retreating to the Internet equivalent of a cabin in the woods with no electricity.\n\n### Goodbye, Wordpress\nI have been using Wordpress from the beginning, and my experience with it has been awesome.  Computer people love Wordpress because it is basically a one-click setup.  You really just dump a bunch of code into a folder, enter your database password, and you are good to go.\n\nThis is why Wordpress, in my book, still reigns supreme as the number one roll-a-new-website-for-your-uncle-over-the-weekend content management system.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-4 col-md-offset-4\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0Xm6_Mhp16I/TcenBY6X2vI/AAAAAAAAAJg/tZuwBK1RiWE/s1600/pedo-smile.png\" height=200>\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Not your shady uncle.  Don't get involved with his website.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nBut I was growing dissatisfied.  Wordpress is written entirely in PHP, so whenever a plugin broke, I basically just had to sit around and wait for it to get fixed.  I don't know PHP, and I certainly don't want to learn it by fixing Wordpress plugins.\n\nSecondly, since it was written for non-programming folk, all the editing and site management is built right into the website.  It's convenient, but this puts a lot of pressure on your authentication for the site.  I was getting at least eight notifications on my phone daily alerting me that someone else was trying to crack my password.  I don't think anyone succeeded, because I don't remember a time where my blog looked like the *Amazon* of male enhancement pills.\n\nLastly, the database was really bumming me out.  It's really easy to set up, but a database is still a database.  They have to be rebooted, backed up, optimized, and occasionally they puke on your couch when they eat something bad out of the garbage (whatever the linux server equivalent of that is).\n\n\n### For the Nerds\n*Warning: incoming nerd talk*\n\nThroughout all these shortcomings, the *Markdown* bandwagon started to look more and more appealing.\n\nWhat is markdown?  It's the new craze, and it's hard to find a web developer these days who is not gushing over it.\n\nMarkdown is basically a text file that gets converted into a web page.  Through basic syntax rules, you can quickly create nice little formatting touches that would take a litle more time to do by hand (taking you out of the creative process of blogging - apparently).\n\nFor example, a markdown file would look something like this:\n<hr>\n\n\t# Everybody Poops\n\n\t### Welcome to my weird poop blog.\n\n\tHi there!  My name is Poop Smith.  Here are my hobbies:\n\n\t* Blogging\n\t* NASDAQ\n\t* Escrow\n\n\t> Toy Story 2 was ok.\n\n\t![](http://www.thepetcollective.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/corgi-puppies.gif \"Corgi Attack\")\n\n\n<hr>\nPretty simple to write.  Here is where the magic lies.  By the time it makes it to the web browser, it looks like this:\n\n<hr>\n\n# Everybody Poops\n\n### Welcome to my weird poop blog.\nHi there!  My name is Poop Smith.  Here are my hobbies:\n\n* Blogging\n* NASDAQ\n* Escrow\n\n> Toy Story 2 was ok.\n\n![](http://www.thepetcollective.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/corgi-puppies.gif \"Corgi Attack\")\n\n<hr>\n\nSo all of my posts are written in markdown now.  I don't have to back them up because they are just pushed to GitHub like a regular source file.  It's all [here](http://github.com/arecker/Blog).  If you are weird enough, I guess, you could deploy your very own version of my Blog on your own website and it would stay up to date.\n\nThe posts are written in Markdown, but the engine is built on a framework called *Django*.\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-4 col-md-offset-4\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://content.internetvideoarchive.com/content/photos/7244/645091_149.jpg\" height=\"150\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>The <em>Django</em> Framework - Completely ungoogleable since 2012</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\nMy one beef with Django is that it is kind of bloaty.  It's meant for really big data entry websites.  My site is a hacked down version of Django.  I basically created a project, then moved everything to a single file appropriately named ```everything.py```.  I starved the project until it scratched my minimalist itch.\n\n\n### Changelog\nOk ok ok - nerd talk over.  Here is what has changed about the site:\n\n* **New Domain**: My blog is now located at [alexrecker.com](http://alexrecker.com).  But you knew that already.  You *are* reading this after all.  I will be setting up a site redirect from the old blog and porting over all the posts that weren't total garbage over to this one.  So you don't have to worry your pretty little head about fixing your bookmarks.\n* **Facebook Comments Only**: I appreciate the comments - especially when they get zesty.  I just don't want to have to store them anymore.  Additionally, the old blog supported comments from Google+ too.  I accompany my decision to drop support for Google+ with a sincere apology to the only person who has ever used Google+ to comment on my Blog.  *Drew - I hope we can still be friends.*\n* **RSS is not working (yet)**: RSS is not supported right now because of a small hang-up - and that is... I'm not smart enough right now to write a RSS generator.  I'm going to throw a few more monkeys and typewriters at it and see what kind of progress I can make.  Again, I offer my sincere apologies to my *one* RSS subscriber.  *Drew - it's not you... it's me.*\n\n\n### Brave New World\nThat being said, welcome to my new site.  There's a lot of stuff still broken, but I'm going to do what I can.  We can take this journey together - blogger and reader marching lock-step, hand-in-hand, making our way through this brave new world of embarassing markdown parsing glitches and catastrophic runtime errors.\n\nAnd please be noisy!  Beat the hell out of this thing.  You can't battle test a website without thowing some grenades.  Go ahead and load it up on your tablet, iPhone, Wii, and tamagotchi (if you still have one laying around).\n\nThanks for reading my test post.

I\u2019m at a loss for words trying to communicate to you how he operated.  Dogs are silly.  Dogs come when you call them.  They are thankful for what they can get, and they are never subtle in how they express themselves.\n\nNoah wasn\u2019t a dog.  The way he operated was entirely\u2026 Machiavellian.  He was subtle \u2013 even manipulative at times.  He had a very particular preference with most things, but would only let you know you disappointed him in the most muted, passive-aggressive way.  Everyone said he was great with kids, but I know what was really going on \u2013 he was a great patronizer.  He would never participate in something unless it was obvious you were the butt of the joke.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of this mystique didn\u2019t fully develop until he became a little jaded with age.  I\u2019d imagine that at a certain point, you eat too many Scooby snacks to ignore the fact that life as a family pet can always get better and more privileged.  As a dog, you just get to the point where it\u2019s hard to get excited about regular dry food.\n\nBut Noah wasn\u2019t always old. He too was a puppy once.  I remember when we got him \u2013 every part of his body looked too big.  It was interesting to watch such a small puppy lumber.  It was like he had too big of a skeleton.  But that\u2019s how you know when a dog is going to get really big \u2013 it\u2019s based on how long they struggle to move around.\n\nThe first time I remember Noah showing any kind of attitude atypical of a new puppy was about two months into the new relationship.  We were all watching TV in the family room when Noah wandered into the basement.  Just as that week\u2019s Survivor was starting to get good, our focus was broken by loud whining.  Pausing the DVR, we all made our way down into the guest bedroom, where we found Noah had lodged himself deep underneath the bed flush up against the back wall.\n\nAt first glance, it looked like Noah was trapped.  But looking more closely, it was clear that he wasn\u2019t wedged at all.  He was positioned like he was totally trapped, but there was obviously enough wiggle room for him to get out.\n\nNot knowing what to do, we all got on our hands and knees, cheering for him to spring himself free.  Just as we all began to call for him, Noah crawled out from under the bed.  It was as if all the gathered attention lifted him out.\n\nWe began to notice this was a regular thing \u2013 whenever the family was preoccupied with something (especially TV), Noah would make his way downstairs, and refuse to come out from underneath the bed until we were all behind his decision.  This continued until he reached the point where his physique allowed it.  At some point, he was forced to stop pretending he was too big for under the bed when he found out he actually WAS too big for it.\n\nBut I make Noah\u2019s cravings for attention make him sound manipulative.  He always had a streak of entertainer in him.  Early on in his training, we quickly found out that he responded well to laughter \u2013 whether he was eating toilet paper off the roll or trying to roll over \u2013 enough cackles could make him do it all night long.\n\nNoah would swim occasionally.  At first, we would all have to admit that we were a little disappointed with his ambitions for the open water.  Rather than getting to frolic and splash with a vibrant water-lover or playing a flashy game of underwater fetch with an all American hound, Noah was more of a reluctant lifeguard.  He would step daintily into the shallow end of the pool, do a couple of placated circles, then step out.  Most of Noah\u2019s time around the pool was spent barking at anyone else who moved.  The great deal of importance he put on barking at moving objects around the pool made it clear to us that he would never stop.  Sometimes we had to lock him in the basement when we wanted to get a good swim in.\n\nNoah was an entitled creature.  Even his most disgusting of activities (usually involving licking something I wouldn\u2019t dare touch) was executed with a hint of regal authority.  The quickest way to offend him was to take him out to pee without rewarding him with a treat.  After all, he put all that work into not peeing all over the floor or on your shoes.  How dare you not reward him for urinating outside?\n\nEspecially because Noah loved to eat.  Noah was a bottomless pit.  Saying he loved anything edible is somehow an understatement.  I would more appropriately extend that to anything malleable.  There was more than one occasion where Noah got into something and I thought, \u201cSurely, this is going to be what kills him.\u201d  Noah survived a comically large Hershey\u2019s chocolate bar.  He survived twenty bratwursts in a sitting.  From slippers to toiletries \u2013 his stomach was a martyr for anything left within three feet of the ground.\n\nNoah was the hallmark of an intelligent jackass.  Some of his most athletic moments happened whenever it was time for him to take a pill.  He knew all the spots to hide.  With the military genius of Hannibal, he would head to the closest corner and make a last stand that could last all night long if you had the gall.  When the  prescription puppy meds came in the fashion of a Trojan Horse tucked in the case of a sausage wrapped with a seductive layer of American cheese, Noah showed off his knife-edge pallet.  He could sift through yogurt, spaghetti, cheese, and even bacon to find the puppy med you were trying to slip him.  Every confrontation would end with that little pill laid proudly at his feet as he licked his chops and feigned ignorance \u2013 all as if to say \u201cThank you.  Any more \u2018pills\u2018?\u201d\n\nBy the time Noah had a little brother to look out for, he had already settled well into old age.  Phineas followed his every move.  Noah commanded him with the confidence that he had earned in his domestic life.  You could call my dog Noah a lot of things \u2013 so long as \u201calpha dog\u201d was on the list too.\n\nI hope you don\u2019t mistake these stories as hard feelings.  I know that when we remember Noah, we make him sound like a prima donna.  But our affection toward him was much more than that.  Yes \u2013 he was a little manipulative at times.  It was scary that an animal could know your emotional weaknesses and exploit them for a fourth meal in the middle of the night.  But that did require he get to know you on a level much deeper than your average bouncy golden retriever mix could touch.  Noah had kind of an alpha dog complex without ever feeling a need to achieve physical excellence, but you can\u2019t help but admire the sense of stewardship he felt over everything included in his territory.  He was sort of a patronizer of authority (especially healthcare professionals), but it takes strength to be a rebel in old age.  Noah was a special dog.  Whenever he was being too needy or high-maintenance, it was never too hard to remember that it takes more character than a dozen mutts put together to develop some of the quirks that Noah had.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you have caught onto this by now, but this is an obituary.  For the last few months of his life, Noah staggered around with a baseball-sized tumor in just about every organ \u2013 still as spunky as the day he learned to whine at the table.  What finally got him was the baseball in his brain.  Noah had a seizure.  Though he came out of it, it was clear he did not have much more time left.\n\nOn Friday, November 22nd Noah ate his last meal.  It was a pagan ensemble for a dog.  A small  bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream and a few strips of bacon.  Noah was taken to the vet shortly after.\n\nThey say most dogs kind of resist it.  They walk around until the injection takes over.  But Noah didn\u2019t try to get up at all.  He just lay there and went to sleep.  I knew it was probably the best sleep he\u2019s gotten in a while.  Noah passed away peacefully with the taste of bacon and ice cream in his mouth and a room full of people that will remember him forever.\n\nThanks for being such a great little brother, Noah.  I won\u2019t bother to back this up with sound doctrine, but I know I\u2019ll see you again someday.  I like knowing you are somewhere where you never have to take a pill again.  You never have to walk up a flight of stairs.  You will never feel threatened or hungry.  Your only memory is temporarily leaving behind a proud, grateful family and the uncontested status of the best dog in the world.\n\nGoodbye, Noah.  And thank you.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/noah.jpg\" height=\"\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small></small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>", "description": "A tender look back on the life of the best little brother I've ever had.", "title": "Noah", "image_url": "http://media.alexrecker.com/images/noahandsarah.jpg", "published": true, "date": "2013-12-05", "slug": "noah"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 36}, {"fields": {"body": "YouTube caught my eye this week.  It was one of those things where the negative response reaches you before you actually know what all the fuss is about.  Before I was aware of any big changes in the internet economy, reddit\u2019s front page was blowing up with backlash against YouTube.  Here is the scoop:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bVGp8Z8Yb28\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\nAside from getting the creeps from this weird, artificial friend group making a big deal about this lady\u2019s volcano cake, I didn\u2019t get much from the video.  It wasn\u2019t until I read the official changelog released by Google to clarify what was going on.\n\n> We told you recently that better commenting is coming to YouTube. Starting this week, when you\u2019re watching a video on YouTube, you\u2019ll see comments sorted by people you care about first. If you post videos on your channel, you also have more tools to moderate welcome and unwelcome conversations. This way, YouTube comments will become conversations that matter to you.\n\nIn other words, I think it\u2019s fair to say that Google is trying turn the comments section into a more sensible log of conversations with people you likely know.  All is lock-step with their long term initiative that has been in motion since Google\u2019s purchase of the video-sharing giant.\n\nWhile YouTube was just budding as a phenomenon and entering into its popularity honeymoon, Google plunked down 1.65 billion dollars to call it its own.  Google unwrapped its early Christmas present to find everything it could have wanted \u2013 only there was a little problem.  YouTube\u2019s booming community who made the site so popular were, in large, total douchebags.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/youtubecomments.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>YouTubers are mean at their best, and Satan at their worst.</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe comments were terrible.  People were to free to post videos, as long as they didn\u2019t scroll past the video info or had hide comparable to an Thompson tank.\n\nIt was apparent that Google\u2019s first initiative with their newly acquired fix-up project was to introduce accountability.  For the first few years, this took the form of more proactive comment moderation.  YouTube encouraged videographers to mute the offensive and be more vigilant in reporting abuse, but nothing made any noticeable difference.  No matter who was lashing back, your run-of-the-mill YouTube d-bag was fearless.  All you knew about him was his screenname.  He was invincible.\n\nIn 2011, Google rolled another whip out of its garage.  They called it Google+, and it was hyped to unify all of our social networking needs under a company that can do it right (although it has come to my attention that the hype behind Google coming into the ring as a Facebook-killer was contrived \u2013 that Google never wanted G+ to compete with Facebook.  I am looking into it now, because that is definitely not what I remember).\n\nIn only a short period of time of being live, Google+ profiles were on the rise.  I was kind of impressed, initially, until I found out where they were getting all of these new users.\n\nGoogle, in the middle of a night, converted your YouTube account into a Google+ account.  This meant users signing into YouTube were prompted to enter their name (the one their mothers gave \u2018em).  This is what they would be known by on YouTube.\n\nNow I\u2019m not really a YouTube user.  I mean, I use YouTube, but I use it exactly how Google wants me too.  I use it to share videos with people I know, and I comment on the videos with my real name.  But after some mental wrestling, I finally came to appreciate what was scaring people so much.  For a while, YouTube was a safe haven for blowing off steam.  In a single night, you were asked to tack your real name onto every single comment you made (and if you weren\u2019t paying attention that morning, that\u2019s exactly what happened).\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to jump into that yet.  Let\u2019s save the crimes against humanity for another time.  I\u2019m not done condescending  yet.\n\n<br>\n\n### The Fiasco\nI can describe what Google did with YouTube in hindsight as a fiasco without even getting emotionally worked up.  Like I said, I\u2019m not a YouTuber \u2013 nor do I spend a lot of time in the big tech news sector.  But a quick scrape of wikipedia shows that Google never did anything like this again.  Looking at a [list of Google\u2019s buy-outs and acquisitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Google), the YouTube purchase makes it into its top three, lead only by Motorola Mobility and their backend advertising service (Google is, primarily, an advertising company, you know).\n\nBut Google has never bought anything as popular as YouTube was, and they never have since.  I believe this is because the purchase seeded issues that Google is still wrestling with today.\n\nThe root of Google\u2019s issues with the people who use YouTube is that the community does not associate itself with Google.  Why did the switch to real names for YouTube channels get so much back lash?  It\u2019s because the screen names were there first.  Any of the OG\u2019s using YouTube before Google stepped in as the new pimp (or any of the users that predated Google+) chose their screen name because that\u2019s what they wanted to be known as.\n\nThe middle finger emoticons, Swastikas, and sexually charged expletives that hound each cute volcano-dessert-like video announcement of more Google+ integration (not to mention the [building petition of celebrity YouTubers that disapprove of the new commenting system](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1qbg5i/list_of_wellknown_youtubers_who_have_publicly/)) suggest to me that most YouTubers are loyal to YouTube first.\n\nAnd just as much as YouTube doesn\u2019t respect Google, you can be sure that Google doesn\u2019t respect the original YouTube community.  Just take a look at the workflow of how Google plans to transition it\u2019s community.\n\n1. You log into YouTube using your fun, quirky username.\n2. YouTube asks you if you want to use your real name in your profile, instead of your username.\n3. Wanting to remain anonymous, you click \u2018No\u2019\n\nHere is the kicker.  Want to see what screen shows up next?\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/youtubemessage.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>Can you imagine how many people have cursed at this caption box?</small>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\u201cOk.  We\u2019ll ask you again later.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it.  No opt out.  I didn\u2019t understand this at first.  Is Google going to roofie me later, then get me to log into YouTube?  If I don\u2019t want to use my name on YouTube, I\u2019m not sure what could change my mind \u201clater\u201d, other than a family member of mine being held hostage.\n\nA [wise man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2CbbBLVaPk) told me something  about writing a website for  users.  Treat your users like they are drunk.  Make all the buttons big and easy to find.  Make everything really simple.\n\nBut don\u2019t treat your user like they are stupid.  Note that a man with an IQ of 170 still has that IQ when he is drunk.  His vision may be blurry, so you make the buttons easy to see.  He may have a hard time balancing, so you show him where to go.  But you do not treat him like an idiot.\n\nGoogle prompting you for your real name, then simply ignoring your preferences is disrespectful.  If you want to mandate things, just do it.  Follow the example of Facebook by pissing off your users with a new layout design, then turn off your monitor and wait for everything to blow over.  OR \u2013 allow your user to continue to use their preferences.  Either of these choices would get backlash, but at least you would treat your users like their opinion matters.\n\nGoogle bought YouTube and got what they asked for, but they forgot to look out for the very people that made YouTube so valuable in the first place.  We all wanted Google to come in and just improve things in the background.  If only YouTube stayed the same, and Google just ran the warehouse a little more smoothly.  It is becoming clear that this is not Google\u2019s intention.  You can choose to run from it, scream at it, or contact your local congressman about it, but there is a glimmer in Google\u2019s eye of a deanonymized YouTube, and perhaps a deanonymized Internet.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-centered col-lg-6\">\n        <div class=\"thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"http://media.alexrecker.com/images/thenandnow.jpg\">\n            <div class=\"caption\">\n                <small>What have we become?

I was going to go a little deeper and discuss something that is a little closer to my heart, but I will have to save it.\n\nNext week: the importance of anonymity on the Internet.\n\nThanks for reading (if you made it this far).

I worked there for probably about 7 years.  Given that the role of a *barista* is one that takes only about 2 years to master, my exposure is more rigorous than most.  When things were slow, I enjoyed contemplating ways to explain the notoriously obfuscated menu selection at Starbucks.\n\nIt really isn't as bad as people think.  Despite the fact that all the drinks follow a pretty reasonable pattern, there is always at least one comic strip in the Sunday funnies that rips on all those silly *frabba-mocha-china twists* enjoyed by the very haughty coffee elite.\n\nDear reader, I give you the fruits of that contemplation.  I present to you everything you ever need to know about making coffee, drinking coffee, and ordering coffee.\n\n# The Cup of Coffee\n\nCoffee beans aren't really *beans*.  Think of it like the pit you would find in a berry.  The coffee bean is actually the seed of the coffee berry.\n\n![All coffee cherries are covered in sensual photography-friendly condensation](http://www.fertility-health.com/images/fertility-and-caffeine-coffee-berry.jpg)\n\nThe pits are sifted out and roasted.  All that needs to happen now is for the pit to be dissolved in water.  Technically, just leaving it in a cold glass of water will give you a cup of coffee - *in about a hundred years*.  To speed of the naturally slow process, the coffee beans are ground up and the host water is heated.  This speeds up the formation of the solution.\n\nAt this point we are getting closer.  We have a mug of hot water darkened by roasted pits - but naturally not everything is going to disappear into the water.  Most of the bean will be left at the bottom.  The rest of the process exists to simply remove the refuse from the solution.  What a paper filter or a metal press accomplishes can be hastily simulated by scooping out this  refuse with a spoon.\n\n### Grinding\n\nSo why even buy coffee without grinding it?  It's because grinding the coffee bean makes it easier for air and light to turn all those *heavenly oils* into rancid garbage.  In order for oils to go bad in your pantry, they have to interact with oxygen.  Oxygen is a gas, so it is only going to be able to interact with the *surface* of the bean.  Grinding the bean increases the surface area, thus increasing the rate of degradation.\n\nIf you can help it, try not to grind your beans until you are ready to brew them.  If you don't have a grinder, only grind about a week's worth of coffee at a time.\n\n### Decaffeination\n\nThe process of removing caffeine from coffee is disappointingly simple.  If you were like me, you pictured a super lab moving commercial quantities of coffee through a big smoky factory filled with mysterious chemicals.\n\nBut ironically, the most cost effective way of removing caffeine is with water itself.  The *Swiss water method* simply involves brewing a cup of coffee without grinding the beans, then recollecting and drying them.\n\nThe reason why this works is because caffeine is *sort of* soluble in water.  Additionally, it *mostly* hangs out on the outside of the bean within all of the oil that was sweated out during the roasting process.  Running the bean through hot water leaves the body of the bean in tact while roughly stripping out the caffeine rich layer of oil on the outside.\n\nThe unfortunate part about decaffeination is that plenty of other delicious components of coffee are also *sort of* soluble in water.  The Swiss Water method throws out the baby with the bath water, leaving a much less lively tasting coffee with 80% less caffeine.\n\n![Swiss scientists are now exploring the effects of bathing themselves in hot water.](http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/cheu.gif)\n\nIs 80% decaf really the best that modern science can do?  Walter White certainly wouldn't approve of that purity.  Certainly not.  Caffeine may be *sort of* soluble in water, but it is even more soluble in carbon dioxide.  Coffee beans can be effectively 99% decaffeinated by passing them through a super critical medium of carbon dioxide.  Even more appealing, many of the other tasty components in the coffee bean ignore carbon dioxide as a solvent, making the extraction much more exclusive.\n\nSo why don't we use this instead?  It is because of the *super critical* part.  This means that the carbon dioxide is subject to both insane pressure and insane heat, yielding a big hot gassy-liquid identity crisis.  Performing this kind of extraction on a commercial scale means subjecting a humble coffee engineer to the dangers of exploding hot metal and glass.  \n\n# The Latte\nSo we have coffee - a beverage which is the end product of passing hot water through ground of coffee cherry pits.  Where did all this *latte* crap come from?\n\n### A Fake Story about France\n\nSay you have a bunch of French people sitting around drinking this new coffee drink.  They find it bitter, and they only continue to drink it to look fancy.  Finally, one of their more clever trendsetters discovers that putting milk into the coffee mellows it out - making it more drinkable.\n\nSome are content with only putting a splash in, but most still find it bitter and watery.  They also notice that the more milk you add, the more dilute the coffee tastes.  There had to be a way to make the coffee creamier without diluting the coffee!\n\nScientist began to examine the method.  A solution that sounded promising at first was *replacing* the water with milk.  Instead of pouring hot water through the filter, why not use milk instead?\n\nIt turns out milk sucks at being water.  The milk took much longer to pass through the filter, and it barely took up any of the beans' flavor.  Another approach was needed.\n\nWater was necessary - *but not as much*.  The coffee was brewed with as little water as possible, using the extra help of grinding the beans much smaller and forcing the water through a much finer filter.  What spit out of the prototype was a powerful, concentrated shot glass amount of coffee.  The french were delighted to find that adding milk to this form produced a creamy cup of coffee - fundamentally a cup of coffee with most of the water replaced with milk.\n\n### Making the Story Real\n\nNone of that actually happened that way.  I would never expect a serious group of French scientists to try to pour hot milk through a coffee maker (I tried it with lemonade once.  Maybe I was on to something there...).  But the components are true to their form.  The concentrated coffee in the allegory is *espresso*.  It is concentrated coffee brewed in a shotglass amount of water.  It is much stronger, and most prefer to dilute it with hot milk.  Doing this yields a *latte*.  Because the milk is heated with steam, froth forms at the top of the drink.  When the espresso is diluted with half milk and half foam, this yields a *cappuccino*.\n\nEvery other drink on the Starbucks menu is a modification of these drinks.  What happens when you take a *latte* and add *chocolate*?  It is a cup of coffee brewed with hot chocolate instead of water.  Starbucks calls it a *mocha*.  Add vanilla to make it a *vanilla* latte.  Add hazelnut to make it a *hazelnut* latte.  Finally seeing a pattern? \n\n# The Sizes\n\nTall.  Grande.  Venti.  Starbucks opts to use these words instead of \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\".  I've heard a lot of people see this on our menu and give up on the whole experience - as if learning these three words is the most information they have ever had to commit to memory.  The words are there because they are fun.  Starbucks customers don't want to feel like they are ordering a diet coke from a 7 Eleven.  It just adds to their experience - and since you have no problem turning a blind eye to your 19 year old son binge watching *My Little Pony*, you should have no problem allowing people to do something that makes them happy that has nothing to do with you.\n\nJust say \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\".  As much trouble as Starbucks gets in for cultivating a culture of arrogance, we just as much love the regulars that trudge in dry wall dust from their work boots and plop down $1.50 for a \"small coffee\" - exact words.\n\nSo no more complaining about *those ridiculous sizes at Starbucks*, ok?  Just be yourself next time.\n\n![And if this guy demands you use his fancy words, you just take your $1.50 elsewhere.](http://makeameme.org/media/templates/250/hipster_barista.jpg)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo there is pretty much everything you need to know to get to know your coffee shop.  Don't use this knowledge for evil.  Always be nice, ask questions when you care about the answer, and don't ever pretend you know all about something when you don't care about it to begin with.\n\nAnd tip your Baristas, too.  At some point of any given day, they probably will have to clean a toilet.", "description": "I worked at Starbucks for about seven years.  The system is a lot simpler than you would think.

I know a lot of you must have a flurry of self-improving ideas dancing around in your head.  It's that time of year, after all.  Watch less TV.  Learn to juggle.  Commit fewer murders.  It's our nature to yearn for a clean start around this time of year.\n\nI had that yearning sometime around this past September.  For the twenty-or-so years before this past September, life was one big happy plate of nachos.  I ate what I wanted and drizzled it in whatever I wanted.  There was no such thing as weight, calories, or exercise.  Sometimes I would jokingly describe myself as anti-athletic, but I certainly didn't think I was fat.  In my brain, I was still just the six foot, hundred eighty pound average male I had been since sophomore year of high school.\n\nThen this past September, I stepped on the scale.  I was *235 pounds*.  I felt fat, and now I had the numbers to prove it.  Suddenly, pictures started to jump out at me.  The first I remember was when I proposed to Marissa.\n\n![Marissa sharing sparkling grape juice with a well-dressed manatee.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/fatGuyAtShedd.png)\n\nHere is another photo that terrified me.  This was right before we left for our stay-at-home honeymoon.\n\n![Marissa and her beautiful sister's posing with a grizzly bear.  I thought they were supposed to be hibernating...](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/fatGuyGivingPeaceSign.png)\n\nAll of this was a big shock to me.  I had *never* thought about my weight before.  I had no idea what I was doing wrong, and I didn't know where to start.\n\nIn sort of a desperate cry for help, I bought a pair of gym shoes and attempted to run outside.  It was hailing, I was wearing black dress socks, and I was running along side of the road.  There was ice, and I fell down about three times, but I pressed on valiantly as if somehow my penitence would make me lose all the weight in one painful jog through freezing rain.  I puked when I got home.\n\nLucky for me, my wife put a stop to this madness.  It was as if all of the sudden I remembered that she had a degree in health science.  She got me back in the gym running a mile at a time at a challenging 6 mph.  On top of that, I started managing my portions with *LoseIt*, a weight loss app I found.\n\nThe first ten pounds were exciting.  They seemed to just kind of melt off.  But the ten after that took a lot of patience.  It took a lot of time for me to understand how much your body weight can fluctuate.  Your weight will not always make sense from a day-to-day perspective.\n\nOnce I hit 210, things turned great.  It was almost like my previously sedated and dying body awoke and said something like *Oh yeah - I'm only twenty-four years old*.  Things happened really quickly after that.\n\nSo it's January 3rd, 2015.  I currently weight 188 lbs.  It's not the most dramatic transformation out there, but I'm putting it out there in hopes it will motivate you.  All in all, here is what I've learned over the past few months.\n\n### 1. Eating *healthy* is not the same as eating *less*\n\nSetting out to lose weight does not mean fasting from sugar and switching to an all kale diet.  Most of the time, it's just a matter of eating less.  I still occasionally eat fast food, except I order much less than I did before.  Those are probably things I should *stop* eating all together, but I think the real enemies are foods with *ambiguous portions*.  Stuff like a big bread bowl of Panera soup or a meal from Boston Market.\n\n### 2. Know as much as you can\n\nCalories are wonderful.  They are a direct measurement of *how much energy is needed* to burn off the food.  Weather your are concerned with a single stick of butter or a suitcase full of carrots, this number will stand.  This system is designed to make eating decisions easier.\n\nA can of coke is 140 calories.  A PB&J is about 350.  A cinnamon crunch bagel is 450 calories.  Now, would you rather have a PB&J AND a beer, or one cinnamon crunch bagel?\n\nThe moral of the story is that everything from Panera bread is awful, and you should just go home and drink a beer instead.\n\n### 3. Working out is hard\n\nThis was a hard lesson I had to learn.  Looking from the outside in, exercise seems awesome.  Anyone who would identify themselves as a runner has plenty to say about the magical feeling of *the runner's high* and *gym camaraderie*.  I have been running for about five months now, and I still hate every minute of it.  I'm getting better, and I can run for about 4 miles straight, but every minute is still just excruciating.  If I was in it for *the high*, I would be seriously disappointed.\n\nBut I still run because I still have a debt to pay.  I spent too many days consuming more energy than I needed.  Every second feels like hell, but it's something sinners like me must do to win back a normal body again.  I deal with the pain by turning up the rap music really loudly and thinking about the 2 oz. of ice cream I can eat when I get home.\n\n# In closing\n\nI still have eight more pounds to go before I can stop scanning the bar code of every Twix bar I eat, I'm not worried about it.  There's really no secret to losing weight.  Just figure out how much food you can eat every day, and go running when you eat too much.\n\nHere's to a much thinner 2015, readers.  All this talk about weight loss is making me want some pizza.  See you at the gym, everybody.\n\n![Obligatory \"After\" picture](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/after.jpg)\n", "description": "Happy new year, everybody.  It's the season for gym memberships.

I share my mediocre weight loss journey to date.", "title": "Weight", "image_url": "http://media.alexrecker.com/images/hippo.jpg", "published": true, "date": "2015-01-03", "slug": "weight"}, "model": "blogging.post", "pk": 39}, {"fields": {"body": "I like to write, but not everyone likes to read my writing.  I\u2019m totally ok with that.  I\u2019m full-fledged comfortable with being indexed as an amateur writer.\n\nI started getting excited about writing around when I was in fifth grade.  It was a magical time when I realized that writing wasn\u2019t just a chore.  The teacher actually took the time to read things you wrote in your assignment.  Unlike the math practice sheets and the multiple choice history tests she would grade, a written assignment was the only time you held her full attention for longer than forty five seconds.\n\nIt was the perfect time to cram in all kinds of smart ass remarks.  We were all in fifth grade - and we all remember how dull and cartoon-centric our senses of humor were.  But the chance to tell the teacher something directly appealed to me.  This alone was enough to motivate me to donate an extra hour or two for each writing assignment I took home.\n\nIf I had proper *glory years* of writing, it would certainly be high school.  I wrote every word under the presumption that I was a raging genius, and I wasn\u2019t challenged in those presumptions nearly often enough.  I may have tried harder than the other students, but I wish teachers had the gumption to call out the thesaurus held puppet strings more often.  The fact that I had no trouble writing a thousand flowery words on anything should have raised suspicion that I have given at least a thousand words of *though* to anything.  Whether it was *The Old Man and the Sea*, the discovery of oxygen, the deeds of Martin Luther, or what motivated Nathaniel Hawthorne to write the *Scarlett Letter*, I always had plenty to say.  Looking back, it\u2019s easy to see why nobody really challenged me on my flowery language and transitional phrase smoke screens.  For a high school teacher, there is nothing more exhilarating than a student participating in something.  Apathy must be the single most ubiquitous weed in the garden of minds they\u2019ve been given.  But at this point, writing meant only a bag of sunflower seeds and forty five minutes rattling the keyboard of my Windows 98 desktop computer.\n\n![You see an old computer, I see a 32 bit friend.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/desktop98.gif)\n\nCollege kicked my butt.  Though watching my puppet show fall apart under collegiate scrutiny may have been painful at the time, that pill I swallowed was the healthiest medication I could have taken.  For whatever reason, my routine wasn\u2019t working.  The faithful ritual of *scratch outline, sunflower seeds, and forty five minutes at a computer* wasn\u2019t cutting it in the big leagues anymore.  It was a system I had relied on - a system that had earned me secondary school accolades and even got me into college, but no one here was impressed.  \n\nIt turns out, college professors want you to actually communicate ideas.  I had learned how to word fence, play with words, assert a good understanding of sentence structure, and even flex a pretty respectable vocabulary, but I don\u2019t think I ever had to actually communicate an idea. The few writing gen eds I took ensured that my sidecar dream of writing in a professional arena died on the vine.\n\nIf this sounds sad, I don\u2019t mean it to.  I wasn\u2019t surprised that my writing style didn\u2019t cut it in college.  If I were to illustrate my learning journey on an X Y axis, it would be a straight line from 1998 to 2014.  I haven\u2019t changed a thing for about sixteen years. Writing anything is still just forty five minutes at a keyboard riding shotgun with a bag of sunflower seeds.  The truth is that I have never really challenged myself in communicating concrete ideas.  I may have learned to amuse a reader to some extent, make monotonous sentences a little more interesting, and carry an essay conversation, but I was severely malnourished in the primary purpose of professional writing.  I\u2019m not very convincing, and being relentlessly ironic is not the same thing as convincing.\n\nIf it means something to you, I\u2019ve always followed some basic rules when writing.\n\n# 1. Don\u2019t use a thesaurus\nOne of the worst things you can do to a paper, in my opinion, is write it in full, then replace words with alternatives provided in a thesaurus.  Your paper should be a conversation.  Ripping out fifteen words and replacing them with ones you don\u2019t know ruins the organic origin.  I kind of envision this process as performing fifteen organ transplants on one patient in a sitting.  If you switch out fifteen organs, one of them is bound to \u2018reject the host\u2019.  The same rings true with words.  If you replace fifteen of your words with ones you just learned, one of them is bound to raise suspicion.  And once you are pegged as a thesaurus transplant writer, no one will ever read you with enthusiasm again.\n\nIn my opinion, word complexity should be evenly dispersed.  I organize all English words I know by complexity like so:\n\n* Level 0: Basic content fillers.  *You, the, and, this, please*.  The kind of words you would expect a four year old to have mastered.\n* Level 1: These words rest in a fleshy, but still minority part of general vocabulary.  They are easily the most important.  Words like *hostile, enigma, indignant,* and *infallible*.  Most of these should be digestible by adults.\n* Level 2: These words are obnoxious when used in repeated succession, because there is really no other place you could possibly learn them without a daily word-of-the-day email or jamming your finger at random in an Oxford dictionary.  These are words like *alacrity* and *acerbic*.\n\nIn my opinion, a good paper should be an even dispersal of level 0\u2019s and level 1\u2019s, with only a modest garnish of level 2\u2019s.\n\n# 2. Writing should flow\nEven if it is an assignment you don\u2019t care for, everything you write should give you a little aesthetic satisfaction.  Good writing should feel good leaving your fingers.  If you don\u2019t feel right about a paragraph you have just written, don\u2019t hesitate to delete it.  Bad writing should always be deleted, not worked in.  Plus, you have probably written a number of average paragraphs that led you into a bad paragraph.  Never sign off on something that doesn\u2019t make you feel right about it.  Everything should marginally sparkle.\n\n# 3. Don\u2019t write if you are not feeling it\nWriting isn\u2019t something you can just get into through beginning.  It\u2019s not geometry - where you just have to \u2018get into the mood\u2019. If you don\u2019t feel like writing, spare us all and just don\u2019t write.  Unfortunately, you don\u2019t always get to be your own boss with writing assignments and their deadlines.  Consequently, this rule might have to undergo a bit of a mutation - reading *Capitalize* on the moments you are really feeling it.  Do what you have to do, but never commit the crime of hiding your enthusiasm for an assignment.\n\n# 4. If you need to break rules, use dashes\nDashes are magical.  They basically just serve as a license to kill - the rules of grammar.  Injecting mid-sentence dashes excuses all run on sentences, imbalanced clauses, and discontinuous punctuation.  Maybe it\u2019s just the way I think, but dashes always feel good.\n\nSo those are the four secrets to mediocre blogging-level writing.

We bravely committed to finishing the film *Barry Lyndon* in one night.  At 11:30 PM - well past my adult bed time - the word \u201cIntermission\u201d flashed on the screen and completely demoralized us.  We had to skip a night and finish it the following night.\n\nI learned something about Kubrick.  I thought he only did demented stuff.  But I report to you that *Barry Lyndon* was long, beautiful, and totally PG.  No murders, sex cults, or dystopia.  I learned that Kubrick had the capacity to be very normal.  I got a sense that this was his nod to the academy.\n\nPart 1 of the movie was called *By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon*.  I like to refer to it as *Barry shoots a guy in the face*.  I don\u2019t mean to ruin it, but this guy named Barry really does shoot a guy in the face.  More specifically, it\u2019s a British general that\u2019s in love with his cousin.  Barry kills him in a duel and flees the country.  He deserts two armies and marries a rich lady, assuming her wealth and status.\n\nPart 2 is a classic obsession-driven downward spiral.  He antagonizes his eldest step son by doting on his youngest son.  The youngest son dies and Barry drinks himself silly.  The eldest son returns to challenge his father to a gun duel and - *pause for irony* - Barry totally gets shot.\n\nI will say that for how long this movie was, it moved at a decent clip.  For a guy that gets antsy in Lord of the Rings, I was really surprised with myself that I made it through a three hour long movie set during the Seven Years War.  Before today, even just saying the word \u201cPrussia\u201d made me yawn.\n\nIt\u2019s a story of luck, obsession, and rich person douchebaggery.  Luck was clearly an important part of the story.  Barry was a professional gambler and, taking the odd events that lead to his rising status for granted, fell into the gambler\u2019s fallacy and lost it all.\n\n# Alex\u2019s Review\n\nAlbeit long, this movie was a real palette cleanser.  If you are into the Pride and Prejudice scene and you have a whole afternoon to kill, give *Barry Lyndon* a shot (*in the face*).\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n\n# Marissa\u2019s Thoughts\n\nI have to be honest, I don\u2019t have any extensive analytical theories about this movie. As we were watching Barry Lyndon I was searching and searching for some hidden meaning or some odd unexpected conclusions. After watching about half the movie I realized that Barry Lyndon is just a solid, well- written, intriguing early historic tale of a young man. It follow him from his first love to late in his life. The movie is three hours long, so when I say that it follows his life, I mean it. Alex and I did have to watch the movie in two sittings (sorry for the late post!) but after watching both parts of the movie, we were again pleased with another Kubrick film. \nMy one comment regarding the movie is that it (like many other films) follows the unexpectedness of events in life. Especially after having graduated from college you think that you have every step of your life planned out for you. The truth is that we never know what the next step in life will truly be. In Barry Lyndon this point is well exaggerated as the main character Barry goes from one side of a war to another and from poverty to royalty. Overall this movie is a particularly good film to sit down and watch with a good meal, a good drink, and good company. I would give Barry Lyndon a 7.5/10. I would go higher up, but personally it was a bit dry, but what can you expect from a movie made in the 70\u2019s! \n\n# Marissa\u2019s Rating\n\nOverall this movie is a particularly good film to sit down and watch with a good meal, a good drink, and good company.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-half-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>\n<i class=\"fa fa-star-o\"></i>", "description": "My wife and I review the movie Barry Lyndon.

It\u2019s been a while.  I had to take a longer hiatus from opinion exposition because Kubrick week took a lot out of me.  We technically didn\u2019t even finish it.  We stopped at the intermission of *A Space Odyssey*, and just started watching *Gilmore Gilrs* instead.  The lesson here is that you cannot do a Kubrick movie marathon the same way you would do a Star Wars marathon.  I feel like if we did actually finish his filmography in a week, Marissa and I would have had to start smoking heavily, speaking in British accents, and criticising scotch.\n\n# Netflix, the Impetus\n\nRockford doesn\u2019t really have a vibrant night life, so like most nights we were driven to another Netflix documentary.  *Mortified Nation* featured regular Americans reading humorous excerpts from their diaries.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the best documentary.  You only need ten to twenty minutes to glean as much as it has to offer.  We stopped the movie half way through and turned to our own diaries.\n\nMarissa\u2019s was adorable, but expected.  She was smart, godly, conscientious, and open to new ideas.  There were a few laughable musings and some misplaced contrition, but  who doesn\u2019t have some of that in their own childhood?\n\nThen I found my journal.\n\n# Quiet Kid\n\nMy journal was forged in that perfect combination of angst, puberty, and absolute arrogance.  Many of you who interact with me regularly probably don\u2019t know that the whole \u2018talking to people\u2019 activity is a relatively new angle I\u2019ve been trying out.  I spent a good several years brooding silently in my head.\n\nQuiet kids get a reputation for being really smart.  The Bible even says *Better to be a silent fool, but considered wise*.  But the big disadvantage to living inside your head day-in-and-day-out is that you don\u2019t have anyone there to hear some of these crazy ideas and say, \u201cHey man, you are being a total jackass right now.\u201d\n\nIf you ever had someone like that in your life, cherish them.  Give them a call right now and shower them in gratitude for never letting your write something like my journal.\n\n# My Great Journal\u2019s Premise\n\nWhen I got a journal, I wasn\u2019t interested in recording things that I did.  Everyone\u2019s routine was mundaine.  I dreaded the words \u2018How was your day\u2019, and would want to crawl out of my skin every time I heard them.  I was *much too interesting* for merely describing my daily activities.\n\nI wanted a place to scrawl out all my genius ideas about the universe.  Being a mere high schooler, I couldn\u2019t boast a lot of experience - but I, you know, played a lot of Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\nI was determined to be absolutely uninterpretable, even down to the handrwiting.  I tuned my handwriting into a series of unintelligible slashes and eccentric whips around the page.  After all, I had no time to make any of this *readable*.  The hearts and minds of all these other people around me were at stake.  I had to get my ideas down so my followers would have them forever.\n\nThat being said - are you ready to read my journal, dear reader?\n\n> Chapter 1: Lunacy\n>\n> Nothingness is beginning to sound like tearing between my ears.  What is lunacy?  Insanity... sanity... sane... REALITY?  Maybe the reality is that everyone is, to an extent, insane.\n>\n> Proof:\n>\n> There are some things mortal man will never know (e.g., the span of the universe)\n>\n> The things, although unknown, are yet facts\n>\n> Facts are real, therefore, reality\n>\n> Therefore, all men are not fully in touch with reality\n>\n> QED: Everyone is insane.\n\nHow are you all doing?  Probably throwing a Bible at the mirror, no doubt.  This is heavy stuff, and we are only in chapter one.\n\nOh, and that thing at the end was a proof - like the ones you make in Geometry to prove something is real.  Because I wasn\u2019t just making stuff up.  These are proofs of things that are real.  I usually made these when I was ready to declare another law of the universe.  And if you had asked me what \u201cQED\u201d means, I would have done just about anything but admit I didn\u2019t actually know.\n\nThese \u2018grand revelations\u2019 were usually just me playing around with words.  They usually end with more of a *well teeeeeechnically maybe* truth.  All I was trying to say is that *insanity* is a scale, rather than a yes or no question - something mental health professionals have known for decades, amazingly, without ever consulting my writings.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll borrow from the good poet *Anonymous* who expresses the idea much more succinctly.\n\n> Crazy people see ghosts.  Sane people just ignore them.\n\nI was ridiculous, but I'll bear through the cringe and intellectual silliness for your sake.  Good night, readership.", "description": "My journal from high school.

After my final falling out with the discipline that nourished me for most of my life, a period of brooding introspection showed me a need to give it a proper goodbye - a goodbye I have decided to sign and deliver with a final brain dump of all the awful analogies that have sustained me throughout the years.\n\n\u201cAnalogy\u201d isn\u2019t even the right word for it.  I\u2019m not even sure that \u201callegory\u201d fully captures the true delusion that characterized these long, cumbersome stories that I would flash the frontal lobe of my weary brain with.

A fitting place to begin this mysterious journey of exhibition is the most fundamental question anyone can ask: **Why does anything do anything?**  Teachers often make the mistake of beginning with the more sobering and wondrous examples of this question being answered.  *Why did we drop the Atomic bomb on Japan?  Why does the salmon swim upstream to die?*  Fun for the good students, but we are bad students, remember?  We just want to talk about urine.\n\nWhat would it take to get you to wet your pants in public?  Go ahead and name your price.

Though some would consider the spectacle of themselves publicly \u201caccidenting\u201d to be priceless, I believe we all have our price.\n\n# The party game\n\nNow let us bring in the kind of guy that can ruin any chill party game by recording everyone else\u2019s answers in a spreadsheet.  He is probably seated with his new *Surface* Tablet close at hand, donning a ripe *Big Bang Theory* t shirt, and vehemently insisting that the Zune player was divinely more innovative than the iPhone ever was.\n\n![I\u2019ve chosen Jonah Hill as my personal visual aid](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/jonahhill.jpg)\n\nSo Sir Neckbeard wants to enter everyone\u2019s responses to the fun pee question into a crisp spreadsheet, but he complains that the variety of everybody\u2019s zainy compensatory scenarios don\u2019t make for a very normalized data set.  There will be no way to get any funless numerical data from the set.  He calls the column \u201c*H*\u201d, because it\u2019s the first letter in Heidi Kluhm\u2019s name, for all we know.  He demands that everyone translate their answer to a numerical value.  People go around shouting arbitrary numbers to scale their response, ranging from 1 to 1 million.  But his administrative yammering is silenced by a small, still response in particular.\n\n\u201cNegative ten.\u201d  Sir Neckbeard recoils in disgust.  Who had the gall to corrupt his dataset with a negative number?  The crowd parts, revealing a newborn baby sitting on the floor.  Sir Neckbeard crosses his Cheeto-dusted arms and confronts the baby.\n\n\u201cUm, kind sir?  You gave me a *negative* number.\u201d  The baby, with uncanny dexterity, furrows an aged brow and nods.\n\n\u201cOf course I did, stupid,\u201d he retorted between the calm, collected tounging of a wad of chewing tobacco.  \u201cI was going to piss my pants anyway.  That\u2019s what I do.  I\u2019m a baby.  Make sense?\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered defiantly as Sir Neckbeard tipped his Fedora to the animated baby stranger.  Sir Neckbeard relinquished to his *Surface* to make a very important change to his spreadsheet.  He changed the column title from **H** to **Delta H**.\n\nNeedless to say, this is turning into one weird party.  But my bizarre ruined-party-game-saved-by-demon-possessed-baby analogy hopefully succeeds in introducing the idea of the *Delta H* in chemistry.  It\u2019s written like this.\n\n![](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/deltaH.gif)\n\n# Say \u201centhalpic\u201d\n\nChemists call this **enthalpy**.  If the word means about as much to you as a tribal tattoo, don\u2019t sweat it.  Part of me even suspects that this noun was made up just so we can have the privilege of using its sultry adjective counterpart - *enthalpic*.  You can\u2019t say *enthalpic* too many times.  Go ahead.  While we are whispering things into the soft, fleshy glow of our computer monitors, go ahead and whisper that one too.\n\nBut enthalpy, in lack of an endless possibility of better words I could have chosen, is simply **what a molecule would do for a Klondike bar**.  More broadly, it is what it would take for something to do something.  And Sir Neckbeard?  He\u2019s certainly based on a true story.  There were hundreds of thousands of them that put their broken hearts and throbbing heads together to come up with the biggest buzzkill spreadsheet imaginable.  It\u2019s not just for one \u201cwhat would it take to get you to wet yourself\u201d question either.  Modern science has surveyed thousands of molecules most of the bizarre questions that they could come up with, converting them to a nearly arbitrary number.\n\nAnd the weird, snarky *benjamin-button* baby?  That was just to enforce the reality that some people are going to be wetting themselves later that afternoon whether you offer them money or not.  This is why we have to call the value *the change in enthalpy* - because it\u2019s not always going to be positive.\n\nHere is a snippet of that list.  Note that the \u201cquestions\u201d are rarely worthy of the party game rotation.  Usually, they are something along the lines of \u201cHow much would it take to get you to explode into gas?\u201d  Chemists are weird sometimes.\n\n![What would it take to get me to make myself?  This survey was hardly worth the Panera gift card.](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/enthalpy-decompose.gif)\n\nAlso note that when your are only answering questions for yourself, you are kind of limited in what questions you can put in circulation.  In all the individual examples, the questions usually can just be \u201cHow much to absolutely destroy yourself\u201d or \u201cHow much to just make yourself from scratch\u201d.\n\n# Kissing cousins\n\nSkipping all the important overhead work of applying this to reality, we can steal away and learn some more important relationships having to do with enthalpy.  Imagine you are asked another party question.  *How much would it take for you to kiss your cousin?*  Upfront, you would expect the answers to be universally high numbers. But Sir Neckbeard has left and there have already been enough Natty Lites in circulation to loosen things up a bit.  Most people would hate to kiss their cousin.  Some people have cousins that wouldn\u2019t mind it (Europeans, probably).  Some people admit in a beer-soaked confessional that they would love to kiss their cousin.  Things get complicated.\n\nBut for the spreadsheet we are making, we don\u2019t really have a social responsibility to reflect any of the psychological travesties at bay.  The way I see it, you just take the *Delta H* for cousin 1, the *Delta H* for cousin two, and add them right up.  If you get two normal God-fearing cousins, there you go  - no kiss.  That *Delta H* is high enough for Baseball and Apple Pie to feel safe again.  If you get a cousin who is really into it and a cousin who is more of a \"left-leaning conservative\", you may or may not get a kiss.  If you get two cousins that are *wayyy* into it - well, just call a cab.  That means this party has gotten way too *Craig\u2019s List* for your taste.  If you leave now, you might even  be able to share a cab with man-baby.\n\nThe underlying principle, setting all kissing-cousins aside, is that *the net enthalpy for a reaction is simply the sum of enthalpies*.\n\nWe said all that before, remember?  Just add up the *Detla H*\u2019s.  The same applies for asking in multiples, fractions, and all types of weird abominations and perversions of the analogy that will not be discussed in this blog.\n\n# What about *not* peeing on yourself?\n\nSo you are sharing a cigar with man-baby and waiting for your cab when you see Sir Neckbeard triumphantly emerge from the bushes to once again confront man baby.  He waves his revised spreadsheet in front of man-baby, who gives it a careless glance through a thick wall of cigar smoke.\n\n\u201cI have revised the data set!\u201d  squeals Sir Neckbeard.  Man baby stiffens his leathery jaw, demanding an explanation with his steely eyes.\n\n\u201cThe *new* question is thus: *What would it take to get you to **not** pee on yourself.\u201d  sneered Sir Neckbeard.\n\nMan baby pauses to contemplate the new thought.  To *not* pee on himself... \u201cWell... I guess it would just be the opposite of whatever I said for the other question.  Since I was planning on peeing myself later, it would be kind of a hassle to stop me from doing it.\u201d\n\nNeckbeard shakes his jowls in celebration.  \u201cAHA!  That makes your answer *positive*.  It is once again a normalized data set.\u201d\n\nThough you are in the middle of wrestling tobacco induced hysteria from whatever hardcore Cuban contraband Man baby lit up for you, you manage do communicate one small incongruity you noticed with Neckbeard\u2019s new data set.\n\n\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t everyone else\u2019s number have to be negative?\u201d\n\nSir Neckbeard casts down his *Surface*, shattering it on the patio.  He bows his head in fatal defeat.  You don\u2019t get a chance to relish in your victory, sadly, because your are tripping like nobody\u2019s business on shady Cuban tobacco.  But man-baby is faithful spread the word to everyone in the house.  They all agree that if the question were reversed, their answers would be negative - since none of them were *planning* on wetting themselves later.\n\nThe principle: whatever a molecule has \u201csubmitted\u201d as his answer to the party question, the value can just be negated to reflect its answer to the *reversed question*.\n\n# Building an equation\n\nSo we have actually been building an equation.  It\u2019s the equation that predicts if something is going to do something.  Just as we assigned *what a molecule would do for a Klondike bar* the name *Delta H*, we can take a step back and take a look at the broader question, of which I will paraphrase by quoting Ice T - *Is it about to go down?*\n\nIce T\u2019s question isn\u2019t so much concerned with the molecule\u2019s answer in particular, although that will help with the final answer.  Ice T is more concerned with the public self-wetting as a *phenomenon* - witnessed alike by the wetter, the guy who paid the wetter, and upwards of 100,000 YouTubers.\n\n![Everything in our universe has to answer to Ice T](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/icet.jpg)\n\nThe answer to Ice T\u2019s question is assigned the letter *G*.  Much like our letter *H*, the number reflects how likely it is *about to go down*.  A negative number means it most certainly is, while a positive number means it probably isn\u2019t.\n\nAs of now, we have only pieced together the *H* and the *G*, making our equation rather simple:\n\n![](http://media.alexrecker.com/images/gibbssofar.png)\n\nIce T\u2019s question is only using what is in Neckbeard\u2019s spreadsheet, *or* the sum of *H\u2019s* from all the parties involved in the public stunt.  Next week or so, we will cover what else we need to consider in answering Ice T\u2019s profound question, which will undoubtedly involve a return to the worst Craig\u2019s List party you have ever attended.", "description": "As a lengthy final suicide note to the discipline of chemistry, I have decided to kick off a final brain dump of all the awful analogies that have helped me limp my way out with a degree.

If you thought that was just going to be my uninterrupted theme for eight months and that bummed you out, don\u2019t worry.  I was imagining more it would just be a series that I visit periodically, appending whatever comes to mind.\n\nIf you are one of those people who need *everything* to be in a series, then fine - just call this one *Short bursts of unrelated content*.\n\nI'm getting married in 17 days.  Maybe it's been nerves, but it's harder to focus on bigger themes (or do one thing for longer than two hours).  The most I feel like doing now is simply *Touching Bases*.  Mind if I touch yours, dear reader?\n\n# The direction of this blog\n\nI have been thinking a lot about the direction of this blog - the first being the technology itself.  Since the migration away from Wordpress, I have already changed the underlying framework twice.  I submitted the new design to Reddit critics, and a general consensus admitted that though the idea was novel, it was kind of useless.  One user pointed out I was basically renting a bulldozer to help build a sandcastle.\n\n![Or was it renting a bulldozer to build more bulldozers...](http://www.construction-machine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Bulldozers-Crawler-Tractors-and-Their-Advantages-Over-Wheeled-Tractors.jpg)\n\nSince then, I have switched over to the micro framework *Flask*, but in the latest iterations I am even still under-using my framework.  As it turns out, you can put whatever you want in the address bar following the site address, like ```alexrecker.com/yo-mommas-so-ugly/```, and my web server code basically just sticks a ```.html``` at the end of it.  If an error is thrown, it redirects you to a \u201cmissing page\u201d.\n\n![Now that I mention it, I don\u2019t have a 404 page.  I am taking suggestions though.](http://media02.hongkiat.com/funny-creative-error-404/27-error-404-page.jpg)\n\nThis happens to be the most important part of the site:\n\n\n    @app.route(\u201c/<slug>/\u201d)\n    def get_post(slug):\n        try:\n            post = open(join(appconfig.cache, slug + '.html'), 'r').read()\n            return post\n        except:\n            missing_page = open(join(appconfig.cache, \u2018404.html\u2019), \u2018r\u2019).read()\n            return missing_page\n\n\nWhen I actually want to write a post, I just create a new ```.md``` file named in year-month-date format and run a big ```admin.py``` script I wrote.  This sucks the text file in (along with every other page of the site), and pukes it through one of four templates that prettifies everything.  I\u2019m not even really using a ton of javascript (just a glob or two).\n\nIn the same spirit, I got tired of maintaining three files.  I combined *the entire site* into one file.  It sounds like it would be a lot of code, but it is only 260 lines.  You can check out the current version [here](https://github.com/arecker/Blog/blob/master/admin.py).\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this design is amazing or retarded, but time will tell.  Ultimately, what determines the genius of a code design is how easy it is to maintain.  If you visit my page tomorrow and are greeted by the fine marketing material of America\u2019s favorite male enhancement pill, then you may presume I am rethinking things.  But I am comforted by this - you can always break beautiful things, hack secure things, find weird cases for complicated things, and teach lazy programmers a lesson - but there is no good way to hack *stupid*.  There is literally no place to post or save information on my blog.  The comments are just iframes of Facebook and the search box is a dummy placeholder for text.\n\nAnd then there is the content side of things.  I have been seduced by my analytics page more than once.  I even considered the extreme solution of locking myself out of seeing the number of hits per second.   Refreshing the page all day encourages me to write click bait.  If I continue down this path of people-pleasing posts, in no time I will be just blatantly targeting the Farmville crowd.  *Thirty totally pimped out Farmville rigs.  #28 will make you LITERALLY PUKE all over yourself*.\n\n# Planned features\n\nThe biggest thing I am working on now is a way to subscribe by email.  I don\u2019t think it is something that would be heavily used, but it just sounds like the most fun thing I could be working on right now.  It will probably look like a little popup window containing a single-page-app (dorks feel the need to call them *SPA\u2019s*, which feels a lot harder to say than \u201csingle page app\u201d).  In any case, if you live out of your email and you like to stay on top of blogs that way, it should be right up your alley.\n\n# Getting programmy\n\nSpeaking of code, this post is about \u201cprogrammy\u201d as I think I am going to get.  I don\u2019t think I want to turn this into a development blog - 1 part because I still sort of suck at programming, and 2 parts because that kind of writing is not quite as cathartic as spewing hate about a dumb movie you saw or projecting ridiculous social theories.  All in all, the rule of thumb is that I never expose you to enough code talk to inspire Marissa to throw something at my head.\n\n# Guest writers\n\nAnd, again, I open the door for guest writers.  If you are thinking about writing a blog yourself, the best thing to do is write a post for someone else\u2019s blog.  It gives you the ability to better estimate the kind of commitment it is, and it gets you a decent number of readers to start off with.  If anyone would like to write something that would *not* get my domain flagged by the NSA or make my parents uncomfortable, send it off!\n\nSo that\u2019s it.

As kids, we only went all the way out here when Kelly managed to stutter her way into the regional spelling bee.  One year, we made a whole day of the event, bringing packed lunches and everything we would need to spend the entire day in Rockford for the spelling tournament.  Kelly was eliminated on the worst word - *premier*.\r\n\r\nDon't feel too bad, Kelly.  I actually had to look up the spelling just now.\r\n\r\nI'm nearing the end of my stay in Rockford, and as the moving date is getting closer, I'm seeing now that it is probably going to be a lot harder to bid farewell to the edge of the world than I had anticipated.  I had a wonderful time here.  Rockford is a unique place.\r\n\r\nMy imminent departure got me thinking about some of my favorite spots in Rockford.\r\n\r\n## Beacon Hill\r\n\r\n![](http://thumbs.forrent.com/imgs/fr/propertyFiles/284/034/1/resized/02_130754981701579070640064075004080.jpg)\r\n\r\nI've lived about two years in Beacon Hill apartments.  Around when I was moving in, it was rumored that there was a stabbing the week before.  As a result, people at work began to refer to it affectionately as *stabby heights*.  Sorry to let you all down, but I didn't witness a single stabbing.  \r\n\r\nThe scariest it got for me was on a hot summer night while I was taking out the trash.  Before I tossed the bag into the dumpster, two beady little eyes caught my attention.  I put down the bag and focused on the little glimmer in the darkness.  Slowly, a little face formed around the dark, round, unblinking eyes.  I recoiled in fear.  For some reason, my first thought was *Oh my gosh, there is a kid hanging out in this dumpster.*\r\n\r\n\"Hey - what are you doing in there!  Get out of there!.\"  The kid just sat there motionless.  The stirring of his jaw revealed he was chewing something.\r\n\r\n\"Stop eating the trash!  It's not good for you!\"  I shouted.  No response from the dark stranger.  I took out my phone, remembering I had a flashlight app.\r\n\r\nWith my flashlight out, I could see the face belonged to a raccoon.  I had been talking to a raccoon.  It's a shame there were no witnesses.  I'm sure any bystander would have been amused hearing me shout \"Stop eating garbage, it's not good for you!' at a raccoon in the dumpster.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, as far as violent and dangerous encounters, it could have gotten much worse than a self-righteous scolding of a woodland creature by my dumpster.  I had a great time living in Beacon Hill.  The staff was warm, cordial, and always prompt.  My neighbors were great people too.\r\n\r\n## Blackhawk Forest Preserve\r\n\r\n![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8319/8058372385_6a81baeaae.jpg)\r\n\r\nRockford will always be the town where I discovered my ability to get in shape.  Most of the sweat and tears were shed on the treadmill in the back corner of the Planet Fitness on Alpine Road, but occasionally my wife would convince me to go for a jog outside.\r\n\r\nI hate running outside, but there was plenty of beautiful scenery at the Blackhawk Forest Preserve to take my mind off my own exercise preferences.  Someone once aptly described it to me as where the *Calvin and Hobbes* comics really should have taken place.\r\n\r\nI had heard about an interesting phone app that could spice up the outdoor running I dreaded.  *Zombie Run* turned your run into an interactive audio book where you spent the duration of your workout surviving as a courier in a zombie apocalypse.  It was pretty immersive, incorporating your speed, direction, and music play list into the experience.\r\n\r\nI tried it out.  Marissa wanted to run at a more casual pace, so we split up.  The plan was that I would turn back after a mile and a half, making it a three mile run that would end at the car.\r\n\r\nI must have gotten a little distracted by my zombie audio book.  The adrenaline of running for my life had carried me five miles to where the trail ended.  Mystified and exhausted, I paced around the woods for a few minutes wondering how I would make it back before sunset.  Making matters worse, I had the only set of car keys, so my wife was to be stranded until I returned.\r\n\r\nMy wife had to call the police.  A squad car found me huddled up in some playground equipment.  My wife had taken shelter from the wind in a Port-o-potty.\r\n\r\n## Five Forks\r\n\r\n![](http://fiveforks.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2014/03/fiveforks-lunch-wine-tapas.jpg)\r\n\r\nFive Forks is our favorite restaurant in Rockford.  Don't let the tiny plates and the emphasis on *lunch* fool you.  It's filling - and sure to put you in a good food coma.\r\n\r\nWhen the recent tornados passed through Rockford, I didn't know it was such a big deal.  We were supposed to celebrate my wife's birthday that night, and I had already gotten my dress clothes on.  My wife, nervously watching the radar, recommended we stayed home.\r\n\r\nStay home?  Did I put on uncomfortable dress pants for nothing?  I don't think so.  I wasn't having that at all.  So I was the reason we stupidly ventured out in a tornado hail storm to eat shrimp toast and duck.\r\n\r\nThe tornado missed us, but my wife still teases me about how cavalier this restaurant made me feel during one of the worst tornados Rockford has ever experienced.\r\n\r\nSeriously, try this place out - but make sure hell isn't raining from the sky first.\r\n\r\n## Jo-Jo's Pizza and Pub\r\n\r\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VjBIPHjIOzI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/d3ijbou4pi0/photo.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is where Marissa works, but before my wife made her way behind the bar, it was our favorite place to hang out.\r\n\r\nJo-Jo's is a bar that, from the outside,  seems surgically attached to a laundromat.  Inside, it's a comfortable, personal paradise.  My wife and I have had the best talks over Joe's deep dish pizza.  The hot wings are good too, but I have a hard time talking while eating those.\r\n\r\nI've told a few people this before, but I really think everyone could use a good bar.  I'm blown away by how many people I've met at Jo-Jo's during the short time Marissa has worked there compared to the two years I've been living in Rockford.\r\n\r\n## In Closing\r\n\r\nWe had some good times in Rockford.  I recently celebrated with my work friends at Jo-Jo's, and when I had finally managed to pull the axe out of my forehead the following day, I found a text from one of my co-workers.  I think it's brilliant, so I'm going to completely hijack it.\r\n\r\n> As the boy scout saying goes, leave the campsite in better condition than you found it. I'm a better person for having known you.\r\n\r\nI was deeply humbled, and for the first time it caused me to reflect on the affect *I* had on Rockford.  I was overcome with the feeling that the people of Rockford gave me so much more than I ever thought to give back.  Albeit a little late in our stay, I really hope I have somehow left it better than I had found it.  Not just the city either - but the people.  As we move to Madison in about a month, I'm encouraged to get another chance with another campsite.\r\n\r\nRockford, you certainly left me better than you had found me.  Thanks for the good times.\r\n\r\n", "description": "Farewell, Rockford.
