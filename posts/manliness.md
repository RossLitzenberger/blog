Title: Manliness

Description: An embarassing moment at Lowe's makes me question my own manliness.  What makes a man?  I also talk about why I hate sports.

I'm questioning my masculinity.

It's anatomically there - that's between me and my doctor.  I just constantly question the way I do certain things - like how I hold the steering wheel of my car or where I put my hands when chatting with a fellow dude in the line to use the urinal.  I'm haunted by a growing suspicion that I'm just doing all this stuff *wrongly*.

I tweeted about a very recent moment I had.

Though that moment was 2 parts self-deprecating humor, it was one part genuine humiliation.  How did I find myself holding a purse and a pumpkin spice latte while my wife bear-hugged a sheet of plywood?  The bigger question is how I escaped my teenage years without learning *any* of this stuff.  It wasn't the people in my life that failed me.  Lord knows they tried.  I followed my dad through a respectable array of manly chores and yet the only reason I know the difference between a phillips head and a flat head is that I googled it just a minute ago.

# What Makes a Man

So what makes a man anyway?  A wicked footbal spiral.  A strong, but still vulnerable *falsetto*.  The ability to make your *pecs* do that creepy jumping thing.  We all know the obvious ones.

I think everybody's idea of manliness is changing quickly.  There are so many things that take part in defining it, and those parts ultimately make up our culture or - *brace for a real buzz word* - the zeitgeist.  But maybe we have already crept out of scope!  Maybe if you get guys talking about their ultimate ideal of what makes a man, they will eventually just start talking about their ideal *self* instead - something even women can do.

# I'm a victim of sexism

I really hate professional sports.  Personally, I think all professional sports are a huge waste of time and effort.  I used to make my friends really upset with me when I would fantisize about a world where the NFL had the same place in society as the Ringling Bros. circus.  Both involve highly trained performers that do tricks in front of a paying audience.  But what's the difference between the two in America?  A guy can sit down next to me in a bar and assume I saw yesterday's football game.  If I were to sit down next to him and assume he was at the circus yesterday with me, he would probaly think I'm weird.

I think this whole thing might be technically sexist.  Just because I'm a dude sitting in a bar, you can safely assume I saw the game yesterday.  If I hadn't, then I'm just treated like a weird exception to an assumption that would normally be totally OK.

Do me a favor everybody - if you ever see a dude in a bar who doesn't *obviously* dig sports, open your conversation with "So, do you follow sports at all?"

# Conclusion

Of course, I'm not totally serious.  I don't think I'm ready to commit to calling that 'sexism'.  I mean - if you define sexism as making assumptions based on sex - then it totally is.  But I don't really want to defend that anymore.

Maybe there will come a day where someone will sit next to me and ask me if I'm into sports instead of opening with *Geeeez Romo really screwed the pooch today!*.  Maybe there will come a day where they will even respond "me neither", and we'll whip out our phones and compare custom Android launchers.  Until then, if anybody is planning on asking me what I thought about last night's game, I'll just tell you now.  **That's the thing about Arsenal.  They always try to walk it in.**
