<p>I’m sure Facebook has taken care of letting you guys know by now, but Marissa and I got engaged last Saturday.  I wish I could take credit for everything that went down, but to be perfectly honest, I had no idea what was going to happen.  I never actually met any of the people that helped out before Marissa did.  Truth be told – I was just as surprised as she was walking out onto the patio.  Here is the full story:</p>
<p>I started asking the internet for help with my big day about a month ago.  I had a basic idea of what I wanted.  I wanted to do it at the Shedd Aquarium, and I wanted a little quartet to play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9B747RQM3w">Crazier by Taylor Swift</a>.  Subtlety was the goal here – which is why I chose to post to reddit.com under the alias ‘BEAR_CIRCUMCISER’.  You can read the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1kvj6o/chicagoans_im_looking_to_hire_a_special_task/">original thread here</a>, but the gist of it was that I was looking for a string quartet and connections inside the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-centered col-lg-6">
        <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bearcircumciser.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <small>It’s counter-intuitive, but bizarre, violent, capital-lettered usernames can invoke a lot of trust on certain sites.</small>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The response was incredible.  Tons of people were coming forward all day.  I was passing out my email like a cheap party magician.  Not only did I get plenty of willing decorators, photographers, but also security detail, pilots, and even a piano on wheels.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get too far ahead of myself.  I wasn’t going to let all this excitement make awry the original plan.  I wanted to keep it simple.</p>
<p>The first Redditor to commit was /u/ChicagoRex.  He was a down-to-earth university student who, in the fashion of a fast food fry cook, churned out a gorgeous quartet arrangement of Crazier only a few short days after my request.  Great work /u/ChicagoRex.  Nailed it.</p>
<p>Second to step up was /u/gobucks72, who was able to direct me to a fantastic quartet.  Clark Street Quartet was great to work with.  I sent them the sheet music once, and I didn’t talk to them again until D-Day.</p>
<p>This was all good, but I still faced the daunting task of getting the esteemed Shedd Aquarium to allow us to prance around their facility close to and after closing hours.  I didn’t really know what to do besides pepper their ‘contact us’ link.</p>
<p>But another anonymous internet user to the rescue!  /u/Nema_k piped up about a friend who works in the Aquarium.  This user was able to get Marissa and me into the Aquarium for free.  They even bought us tickets to see the aquatic show.</p>
<p>Things were almost in place, but I was still in need of a photographer and a videographer.  /u/aweekendwarriorf and /u/mooseman90, who, respectively, produced a gorgeous video and a series of really beautiful pictures for the event.  An additional shout to /u/aweekendwarriorf ‘s wife for helping with decorations.</p>
<p>Here is the video put together by Charlie.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Again, this video was done by Charlie Hilbrant (/u/aweekendwarriorf).  This guy is also a pilot, so if you are looking to spin around the Chicago horizon on a romantic aero-tour, you can book that dream-come-true with <a href="http://windycityflyers.com/">Windy City Flyers</a>.</p>

                <small>As far as getting into a prop plane with someone you met on the internet, he’s basically the best you could ask for (sorry ladies… married).</small>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

<p>Seriously, great people.  It takes a lot of character to do as much as they did for people they didn’t even know.  I’m really thankful you guys helped out.</p>
<p>Here are the photos, courtesy of Nick Helfers (/u/mooseman90) at <a href="http://www.citysunsetphotography.com/">City Sunset Photography</a>.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Lastly, I can’t thank the Shedd Aquarium enough.  I am so humbled that they would bend over backwards like this for our special day, with the only payment promised being that ‘I would have, like, a hundred kids and buy them all Shedd memberships’.  Particularly, I would like to thank Denis Frankenfield, who suffered the brunt of my email spamming, and Marco, our generous tour guide.</p>
<p>I really thank everyone who helped out – you taught me that the best way to keep something a secret is to leave it up to a bunch of people on the internet to keep it for you.  What made the day really special is that I was just as surprised as Marissa coming through those doors.  I’ve been kind of walking on air ever since.  I don’t think I could be happier now that I am engaged to the love of my life.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and see you at the wedding!</p>
