<p>I have a dark secret for which I am slowly building the courage to shed light on.  I am trying to become a skateboarder.</p>
<p>It fulfills a need of mine for physical activity – a need which is limited by my shyness.  I ought to be active – I know that – especially working a desk job where the only included cardio is plugging in my headphones (and just wait until I upgrade to a wireless set… soon I can be motionless in the purest sense).  But I’m not really the kind of guy that can roll up to any random basketball court, slip on a “Gold’s Gym” tank top, and grunt “Yo!  Pass the rock.”  Likewise, I won’t be parking at a health club to get my pump on in front of a bunch of sweaty strangers.  On a more serious level, I’m a bit of an introvert, so there are not a lot of options for physical activity.  Off the top of the dome, I can think of skateboarding, bowling, carnival games, and running from the government.</p>
<p><img alt="Jason Bourne is the perfect example of how you can be physically active without any meaningful interpersonal interaction - if you do not count throwing passports and pieces of glass at people" src="http://media.alexrecker.com/images/mattdamon.jpg" /></p>
<p>I’ve spent my first few months crawling parking lots and baseball dugouts, dipping out when someone with a dog walks by for shame that a sociological other will externalize my private hobby before I am ready too.  I’ll take the board out into daylight when I’m ready, thank you.</p>
<p>I’m typically modest, but it didn’t take me long to master every obstacle offered by the endless flat space of a Target parking lot.  I was ready to graduate to the skate park.</p>
<p><img alt="It is clean now, but in time it will be covered in my blood." src="http://media.alexrecker.com/images/bowl.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is the Olympic skate park in Schaumburg.  The park is not lit, so I usually go during the narrow time frame between kids going home for dinner and the nearby softball field finally shutting their lights off for the night.  Sometimes I would have to stall  if there were people that hung around.  I just played Minion Rush on my phone until I got the place to myself.</p>
<p>Tonight, I was running out of time.  There were two stragglers, and from a distance I could tell they were pretty good.  I made a decision.  At least they were hucking on the side of the park opposite to my ledge.  See, the park is pretty big, but I usually just hang out by a little stumpy ledge.  There, I practice the same line.  I jump on the board, kick three times, then try to ollie up on the ledge.  Most times I lose my board and slam my head on the pavement.  Sometimes, I make it up, but panic as the ledge shortly drops off again.  This is when I proceed to lose my board and slam on the pavement – again.  Sometimes, when I am really on fire, I can wipe out before even reaching the ledge.</p>
<p>For twenty minutes, we stayed out of each other’s way.  But on one attempt, he board flung out from my feet.  I squealed as the deck sailed into another skater.  He scooped up my board and walked slowly over to me.</p>
<p>If I had a can of mace, I would have uncapped it.  If I had brass knuckles, I would probably be too embarrassed to do anything with them.  The fella handed me my board and asked, “So are you new at skating.”</p>
<p>Yes.  I am so new at skating.  This helmet also doesn’t fit me, and I ordered everything you see here on Amazon.</p>
<p>“Let me show you what you are doing wrong.”</p>
<p>The dude jumped on his board and demonstrated a crystalline ollie.  After a few more pointers, we got to talking.  Learning they were only sixteen made me embarrassed at how self-conscious I was around them.  The guys, Trevell and Tony, told me not to worry – that no one who skates at the Olympic is a huge tool to newbies.  They were nice kids, and, thanks to my pleasant experience, I am going to keep at it.  I promise to post a GIF of me jumping onto that eight inch ledge once I nail it.</p>
<p>Thanks, you guys.  And if you are reading, Trevell, I stand by my offer.  Bring your chemistry homework next time, and I will show you how I can really shred.</p>
