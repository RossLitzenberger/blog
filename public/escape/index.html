<h3>I'm sorry, Google</h3>
<p>I got a little catty last week.  I wrote a commentary on a document Google made hours after it was released.  The document was ridiculous, but it got a little moody at the end.  I was especially paled when I heard Fibre was getting added to a flurry of <a href="https://fiber.google.com/newcities/">new locations</a> (and is in no way stagnating).   Google is also doing what could be best described as <em>romancing</em> a plethora of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk">opensource robotics projects with Project Tango</a>.  For last week, sorry Google.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>I need the police</h3>
<p>But this week, I need the police.</p>
<p>Wait-a-minute… not one on duty or anything.  That sounded a lot more urgent then I meant it.  What I meant is that I just need to run something by an authority figure so I can get a sense of how valid it is.</p>
<p>I think I have come up with the perfect escape plan.  <strong>Disclaimer: I don’t condone running from the police</strong>.  I also don’t intend to use it myself, and I would certainly regret any of my readers using it to evade the law themselves.  You could say that I am simply doing my civic duty in helping the state lengthen the already long arm of the law.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>The Scenario</h3>
<p>You got a bad rap.  Maybe you are walking on ice and eggshells after an iffy murder charge, or you received a harshly-worded letter regarding some illegally-obtained Shania Twain albums.  Maybe you still have a court date pending for that public drunkenness charge of yours at the Apple store (even though nobody yet knows that’s just how you behave around new Apple products).</p>
<p>The point is you can’t afford to get into trouble.  You have to keep your nose clean… which is why that it is problematic that you <em>just</em> got pulled over on a rural highway by a State policeman.</p>
<p>There is no talking your way out of this one.  Actually, it probably won’t even be a ticket.  You have an order on your head to be deported and/or pistol whipped on site.</p>
<p>Fine – I don’t watch a lot of CSI, so consequently, I can’t escalate this hypothetical scenario to a point where you would admit you have <em>nothing</em> to lose.  You are just going to have to get there without me.  There is literally nothing to lose at this point.  You just need to <em>not</em> get arrested tonight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>My Plan</h3>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Step 1: Floor the Car</h4>
<p>You need to put some distance between you and the policeman.  You need to disappear into the horizon the best you can.</p>
<p>And don’t even tell me you won’t be able to do that.  I learned from watching COPS that a trained policeman won’t jump in his squad car right away.  Apparently, it’s better to stand there and get a better sense of where the perp is heading (yes - you’ve become a <em>perp</em> at this point, mind you).  I don’t get it either, but it works to our advantage for now.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Step 2: Pull Over next to some trees or high corn</h4>
<p>This is crucial.  You need to pull over next to some place that looks prime for escaping on foot.  Don’t worry, if you follow my plan, you won’t be doing a lot of running.  The key is to only make it <em>look</em> like you took off running.  Turn off the car and open the door.</p>

                <small>There is a good chance you are going to get up to 4 or 5 stars. Just keep your cool, OK?</small>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p><br></p>
<h4>Step 3: Climb into your trunk</h4>
<p>You heard me.  Get out of your car, climb into your trunk, and close it right up.</p>
<p>Although my knowledge of police chase protocol comes up short here, I would imagine it would happen something like this…</p>
<ul>
<li>State patrol spots your car pulled over and squeals to a grinding halt</li>
<li>Policeman (and copious backup) jump out and inspect the scene with their guns drawn</li>
<li>Policemen see that your car is empty.  Using their instincts, they notice some bent foliage and conspicuous boot prints near the brushline (clever you)</li>
<li>Search commences in the woods.  They swarm the area with helicopters and maybe even landmines</li>
<li>They can’t find you.  They also don’t know what to do with your car</li>
<li>“Meh.  Call a tow truck.  Let’s just go home.  He was just a speeder anyway.”</li>
<li>Cops go home.  Before the tow truck arrives, you release the trunk latch from the inside (which in my understanding, is a safety requirement in modern sedans)</li>
<li>Drive off, scrap the car (hand it over to Nicholas Cage to strip it, or whatever)</li>
</ul>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>And call Bob your new uncle – you’re free to go.  Sure – maybe it was a little over-the-top, but I really think they don’t even train policemen to check for something this stupid.</p>
<p>So I surrender my idea over to you Internet.  I would be much obliged if somebody stepped forward and set me straight, or, what I find more likely, thanked me profusely for delivering more valuable criminal-minded insight.</p>
