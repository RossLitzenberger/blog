Blog
====

This is my blog.

All posts and page content are stored in markdown format in the *content* folder.  When I want to update the site, I trigger the ```refresh.py``` script that stashes all of the site content in HTML.  That's about it.

***

**TODO:**

* Refactor older posts with new thumbnail CSS
* Refresh sitemap.xml
* RSS
