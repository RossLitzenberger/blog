Blog
====

This is my blog.

It's the actual blog, posts and all, so it would really be of no use to you to clone this repo.
However, if you'd like to mimic the design, you are free to.

The site is managed by ```admin.py```, which takes four arguments:

* ```update```: Updates the site cache
* ```email```: Manages and triggers email subscription engine
* ```test```: Runs unit tests
* ```server```: Runs web server
